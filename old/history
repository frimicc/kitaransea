<P>
In the old times, Men ruled the area with personal power.
Using their psionic abilities, the "Autarchs" could create items from thin
air, see into peoples' minds and control whole populations by force of will.
The Autarchs made alliances with the Illithid to gain this power, and were
corrupted by the evil that they unleashed. Slavery was common and servants were
often mind-controlled to obey their master's every whim. Huge citadels were
constructed, to allow the Autarchs to meditate in peace. They controlled their
empires from these hidden fortresses, having lower-level Autarchs do most of the
real work of governing. 
</P>
<P>
After a few hundred years, there were many who aspired to the Autarch
rank. Infighting became common as each Autarch tried to hold on to control
of his empire. During this period of civil war, a Autarch would be killed
and replaced by another, each more evil and cruel than their predecessor. The
kingdoms split into much smaller states, to the point when the slaves and
peasants in some states couldn't produce enough food to survive, because they
had very little land. 
</P>
<P>
At that point of crisis, the saviours came into sight. A small group of men
learned the tricks of casting magic spells from the elves. They used this
heretofore unknown ability to topple the powerful Autarchs, one by one.
First the smaller, weaker states fell to their fireballs and ice storms, then
the larger ones. 
</P>
<P>
Once a state was liberated from its tyrannical ruler, the group of mages left
one of their own to help them form a new government -- by the consent of the
people. Slavery was outlawed in almost every new state. Many tried to create
democracies; many put the mage who was their protector up on a pedastal,
electing him as their King; some dissolved into anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining Autarchs hated the new states. A great war broke out, as the
Autarchs forgot their own squabbles and started fighting for their power
and their lives. The loss of lives was fantastic as psionics and magic "duked
it out" across battlefields covered with free men and slaves. The two remaining
large empires fought long and hard to destroy the ranks of men and mages. For
several years, neither side could gain the upper hand. Then someone discovered
necromancy.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, as the slave army cut down their enemies, they would rise again from
the dead and continue fighting. Mind-controlled or no, many warriors ran in
terror from the undead. This allowed the mages' armies to make headway against
the Imperial legions of the Autarchs. Within months, the great citadels
were under siege by armies that did not need to eat or sleep and fought as well
during the night as the day. It was only a matter of time before they fell.
</P>
<P>
However, the undead came with a high price. The evil forces unleashed exacted a
heavy toll on the new mages who became Necromancers. Their forms began to
wither, they lost all sense of life and beauty, and slowly started changing,
becoming their own creations. Many of the mage leaders became high-powered
undead, liches and vampires, during this time. As they became more and more
evil, the people who they governed were subjected to ever more increasing
torments. Peasants wondered if they had gained any ground, going from being the
slaves of the Autarchs to being fodder for undead "experiments" and
practically slaves again. 
</P>
<P>
The revolt this time was much less sudden and therefore all the more
impressive. Slowly, people took control of the governments away from the undead
and forced them into hiding, in the low places beneath the earth. Many were
killed by zealous groups, who named the undead "scourge of the living", and
decided that they had no right to continue their existence. Priests began to
realize that their deities did not like the undead, and that they could use
their holy symbols to cause them to run in fear or even disintegrate, withering
from the mighty power of faith. 
</P>
<P>
But, it was not an all-out war. In time, the undead were beaten and man was
ruled only by other men. Some of the mage-kings were benevolent, but some were
as power hungry as the old Autarchs. In some areas new forms of government
appeared: patriarchies ruled by the leaders of a faith, oligarchies ruled by
merchants, feudal systems where maintaining an army was a duty instead of a
right. Minor wars were fought and many of the smaller states merged. 
</P>
<P>
For the next hundred or so years, acquisition and negotiation caused the states
to expand and become fewer in number, until a stable politics was reached. Then
a couple of hundred years saw very little change in the boundaries or forms of
government, as leaders turned their vision inwards, to improve the quality of
life in their own countries.
