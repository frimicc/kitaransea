<A NAME="top">Nomad Tribes</A>
</H2>
<H3>
<A NAME="selenica">Around Selenica</A>
</H3>
<P>
The nomads here have more-or-less settled down. Permanent settlements dot the
plains on the eastern side of the Ruatha Veda. There are four main tribes here.
Each tribe has some similarities and differences, and their own outlook on life.
</P>
<H4>
<A NAME="all">All Tribes</A>
</H4>
<P>
All the tribes here realize that they are becoming &quot;civilized&quot;. Most people
think that is a good thing, but there are always a few who disagree. The
leaders of the tribes live in log houses, also often used as meeting halls.
Others in the tribe live in either tents that have been staked down permanently
or still wander with the flocks of sheep and cattle that the tribe owns. 
</P>
<P>
Most objects are &quot;owned&quot; by the entire tribe. Personal possessions are usually
only what one can carry with him. It is like an extended family -- each person
gives what he can to the tribe, and each takes what he needs. Everyone in a
tribe is usually related, although intermarriage is not discouraged. When
members of two tribes marry, they choose one tribe (usually the woman's) to
join and the other tribe gives up all claim on the couple. This allows a
healthy variety of children and reduces friction between tribes. 
</P>
<H4>
<A NAME="rhuada">Rhuada</A>
</H4>
<P>
The Rhuada (the river is named after them, not the other way around) are one of
the oldest tribes in the land. The group that lives near Selenica is merely a
small part of the larger whole, but that knowledge is not usually shared with
Waylanders... Rhuada worship Chauntea, the Great Mother Goddess, and are
generally Neutral Good in alignment. The tribal leaders often consult the
tribal druids on important matters. The Rhuada worship Chauntea differently
than more &quot;civilized&quot; folk: here, she is worshipped as providing enough food
for the tribe and giving them power to survive persecution; in other lands, she
is merely the goddess of Agriculture, and asked to rain for the crops, help the
soil, etc.
</P>
<H4>
<A NAME="colarran">Colar'ran</A>
</H4>
<P>
This tribe is more recently settled here, in the last fifty years or so. They
are fairly large here, since these are their full numbers: possibly a thousand
or more. They worship Helm, again, differently from other folks. The Watchers,
they examine things carefully and make decisions slowly. Undead have much to
fear from this tribe, and they will often show up to help the Selenica militia
when undead are discovered. The Colar'ran always seem to know what is happening
in far off places, when it is important.
</P>
<H4>
<A NAME="maar">Ma'ar</A>
</H4>
<P>
Obviously less settled than the other three tribes, the Ma'ar are hunters. They
do not graze their own cattle or sheep, and do not farm; they hunt. Masculine
oriented, the women usually spend the day cleaning and cutting the animals the
men bring back. Power within the tribe comes from hunting prowess and physical
strength. They worship Malar, but are not generally evil. The highest honor in
the tribe is to bring down a bull using only the &quot;Claws of Malar&quot;, effectively
your bare hands. There are only a few hundred Ma'ar around Selenica, but most
of the men spend long days and even weeks out on the plains hunting the wild
herds.
</P>
<H4>
<A NAME="boselan">Bo'sel'an</A>
</H4>
<P>
Tending toward the hairy side, many of the Bo'sel'an are not seen around town
during the full moon. No one knows why, but most attribute it to their worship
of Selune. Members of the tribe tend to sleep during the heat of the day and
come out at night, in the light of the moon. More gypsy-like than other tribes,
the Bo'sel'an enjoy entertaining others, and are often found in the city on
evenings, singing in the taverns and dancing in the streets. Likewise, their
encampment on the &quot;wild side&quot; of the river is blazing at night, with fires and
the sound of music and laughter.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="ruatha">Along the Ruatha Veda</A>
</H3>
<P>
Along the Ruatha, the Rhuada and the Colar'ran generally &quot;patrol&quot; the sections
closest to Selenica. While not officially patrols, groups of tribesmen move
along the northern bank and try to keep other tribes from attacking the
encampments on the other side. Such peacemaking is necessary, considering some
of the tribes in the Central Plains...
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="central">In the Central Plains</A>
</H3>
<P>
Here are found tribes worshipping all deities, good and evil, lawful and
chaotic. Wars between tribes are commonplace, as a tribe worshipping Malar
comes into the range of a tribe worshipping Mielikki. Each tribe takes on some
aspect of their god, and not always the best one. It has been said that the
Nomad Lands are a testing ground for deities; as tribes gain and lose members
and ground, so too does the deity. There may even be tribes here who worship
deities unknown to anyone else...
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="nada">Along the Nada Veda</A>
</H3>
<P>
Tribes tend to take advantage of their surroundings: around the Rhu'nada Sea,
they fish and use boats for travel; in the Central Plains, they ride horses to
keep up with the herds; along the rivers, they fish and even attempt to use
water-power for some things. Thus, it should come as no surprise that the
tribes near the edges of the La'nar'ran forest emulate the elves. 
</P>
<P>
See the separate entry for the elves, but the nomads here are all reasonable
woodsmen and tend towards vegetarianism. They often take the &quot;long view&quot; of a
situation, although &quot;long&quot; to the tribes usually means twenty to fifty years.
Thus, this area is very peaceful, with long-term treaties worked out between
tribes as to where to graze, gather food, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the elves trade with the Nomads, and see them as the &quot;best kind
of humans&quot;. The elves have seen what goes on in the upper areas of the Emba
Veda, and already know about the other kinds of humans.
