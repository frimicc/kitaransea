<P>
Beyond the edges of the map, things continue as they are for a little while and
then get harsher. There are no known human cities beyond the map edges, but
farming villages appear here and there. After a couple of weeks' journey, the
lands get more barren and foreboding, less cultivated. Another two or three
days' journey leaves caravans in practical &quot;no-man's land&quot;. Nothing grows here,
and they must survive on what food they carried with them. Very few Nomads are
even found farther than fifteen days' travel from the map edge. No one knows
what is beyond that, but rumors abound. By area, the terrain beyond the map
is:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
South -- Utter desert. Dunes as far as the eye can see, not even a palm tree or
major rock to break the view.
</LI>
<LI>
West -- Plains, leading to a barren jolting moor. Packs of wolves and worgs
travel here, but not much else. Further the land becomes very wet and marshy,
but few know why.
</LI>
<LI>
North -- Mountains. The Telos Mountains stretch the entire breadth of the
civilized area. They are impassable over the top, and only the dwarves know the
passages underneath.
</LI>
<LI>
East -- Grassland, leading to a barren moor. Rolling hills appear and then
mountains, darker than anything seen before. Storms jolt the mountains nightly
and lightning is the main source of light. Dark clouds lie on the other side,
adding another reason not to cross.
</LI>
</UL>
<H2>
<A NAME="mountains">Mountains</A>
</H2>
<P>
In this area, the mountains are all rather similar. The steep side is to the
north, the lee side to the south. These are all newer peaks, tall and pointy,
except in the Oidillaf.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="cruth">Cruth Mountains</A>
</H3>
<P>
Tall mountains protecting the area from the desert winds to the south. They are
inhabited by Mountain dwarves and numbers of humanoids. Giants live in the
farther areas, but have so far stayed away from human towns.
</P>
<P>
These mountains contain salt and plenty of stone, but not much in the way of
metals or gems.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="granos">Granos Mountains</A>
</H3>
<P>
Medium mountains, but spiky. These continue to be the home to numerous
humanoids: orcs, goblins, ogres, hill giants, but not many other monsters,
despite all human efforts to &quot;clean them out&quot;. Ket maintains towns and bases on
the northern slopes, while Beogar patrols the southern edge. Mountain Dwarves
live in the interior, but they are constantly at war with the evil forces
surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, these are the richest mountains in terms of silver and gems, but
also produce stone and coal in abundance.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="telos">Telos Mountains</A>
</H3>
<P>
A huge range, and generally not inhabited by humans, these mountains are tall
and proud. Snow covers some of the upper slopes year-round, and earthquakes are
fairly common as the ground here is still settling. Elves and dwarves live in
the area around the Adri Forest, but not too far from there. No one has ever
crossed the mountains and returned to tell about it. Dragons are seen flying in
the heart of the range sometimes.
</P>
<P>
These mountains provide the best metals and gems, but not the best stone. Coal,
salt, and other things are found here in lesser quantities.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="oidillaf">The Oidillaf</A>
</H3>
<P>
Probably the oldest mountains here, these are not very &quot;peaky&quot;. Rounded tops,
shorter than other ranges make these mountains seem &quot;friendlier&quot;. They are even
livable in places. However, in past conflicts, evil humans and others were
driven into this range and left here. Thus, the place is full of evil groups
trying to survive and regain power. Undead control large portions of the land
and bandits are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mining here produces the best stone and coal, but fewer gems. 
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="forests">Forests</A>
</H2>
<P>
Only the major forests are shown on the map. Much of the hilly country is
covered in trees, and copses dot the plains in Wayland and Athmyr. All the
major forests are home to elves.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="grandwood">Grandwood</A>
</H3>
<P>
Stately, sedate, the Grandwood is an open forest. Trees tower over the ground,
leaving it fairly free of underbrush. The Overking of the Elves lives here, in
a city in the treetops, and therefore the forest is well-tended. Population
density for elves is similar to cultivated land for humans, thus very little of
the area is unused. 
</P>
<P>
Old oaks, redwoods, and other huge hardwoods dominate here, except for the far
south, where fruit trees are plentiful. These orchards provide enough fruit for
the elves and much of Ket.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="adri">Adri Forest</A>
</H3>
<P>
Older, but shorter, the Adri is much more tangled. Every now and then forest
fires sweep sections of the forest, getting rid of old growth and making way
for new trees. The elves keep a constant vigilance for these fires. Paths and
roads lead through the forest, but wandering off the path could get a traveler
lost for days in the brush. The elves live on the ground more than in the
trees, but the Underking lives in a treetop city similar to the one in the
Grandwood. There are fewer elves here, and some of the forest has been given
over to orcs and goblins, on the west side of the river.
</P>
<P>
This is also a hardwood forest, but without orchards and the giant redwoods in
the Grandwood. As the Adri joins the trees on the slopes of the Telos
mountains, the trees get larger and grander. 
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="tabelran">Ta-Bel'Ran</A>
</H3>
<P>
A softwood forest, this area is greatly affected by the sea. The trees here
need lots of moisture, and the forest floor is so damp as to be squishy in
places. Underbrush and ferns grow everywhere. The elves here live on the
ground, because the trees would not support the weight of a building. However,
most larger buildings are built about twenty feet up in the trees, to keep them
safe from the wild boars and deer. This is a wild forest, and the elves try to
keep it that way.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="lanarran">La'Nar'Ran</A>
</H3>
<P>
Also softwood, but a different character than the Ta-Bel'Ran. Fruit grows on
the trees and nuts fall heavily to the ground. In most worlds, this would be a
cultivated forest, but here it has a darker reputation. The elves have made
sure that no one north of the Nada Veda stays in the wood overnight, thus
making it difficult for humans to enjoy the area. The trees actually extend out
to the Emba Veda, but in small copses and little woods, which are all inhabited
by humans.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="seas">Seas</A>
</H2>
<P>
All the water in the area is fresh water. Salt water is only found in the
desert, in the south. 
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="kitaran">Kitaran Sea</A>
</H3>
<P>
The largest body of water in the area is fed by all the rivers. Tides are
small, and even small boats can venture across the sea. At the narrowest point,
it is only four days' sail from H&aelig;dburg to Telandyr. Storms are generally
small and few boats capsize. There is very little fear of sailing here, and
most of the commerce of the region is shipped around the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Many fish are found here, and in the depths even huge fish and things like
Dragon Turtles and giant Octopi live. It is all considered temperate fresh
water.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="rhunada">Rhu'nada Sea</A>
</H3>
<P>
Also temperate fresh water, with the same kinds of aquatic denizens. However,
since this sea connects less important things, it is not sailed much. In the
past, when the Autarch Costanza ruled the area, it was used much more, with
cities built all around it and his capital on the main island. The ruins are
still there, but they have been pretty much cleaned out over the years.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="rivers">Rivers</A>
</H2>
<P>
All rivers flow towards the Seas.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="athas">Athas River</A>
</H3>
<P>
Slow moving and wide, this is the main corridor of travel for Ket. From Maaros
to Gothos, the river is practically covered with boats and barges, the banks
worn nearly to the stone due to the foot traffic. As it nears the mouth, it
splits and wanders its way through the marshy delta under the city of Gothos. 
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="blue">Blue River</A>
</H3>
<P>
Wide, but reasonably swift, this river carries traffic from Sauthos up into
Ket. When going upstream a rope attached to a horse or donkey on the bank is
used to pull boats against the current.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="emba">Emba Veda</A>
</H3>
<P>
A narrow, but slow and long-running river, it still carries its Elvish name.
The river is only wide enough for one barge at a time, so many towns along the
banks have built &quot;passing areas&quot; to hold a barge temporarily while one passes
the other way. When two boats meet in the river, one of them has to back up to
the last passing area -- as expected, this can get very competitive at times.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="nada">Nada Veda</A>
</H3>
<P>
Generally slow moving, this narrow river meanders forever across the plain to
get to the Rhu'nada Sea. Very little traffic is found on it, though, since the
nomads have no need to go anywhere. It is primarily used for fishing and water
for the nomads living along its banks.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="ruatha">Ruatha Veda</A>
</H3>
<P>
Slow moving and narrow, this river practically begs to be crossed. At some
points, it is shallow enough that a man can walk across without getting his
tunic wet. Thus, Athmyr finds it necessary to guard every inch of its southern
bank. The nomads on the northern side usually give it a wide berth, because
being seen there is asking to be shot by the soldiers. No one travels the
river, except for Athmyrian patrols.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="atrek">Atrek River</A>
</H3>
<P>
Rushing down from the mountains, this river moves far too fast for boats until
it reaches Atrek City. From there, it widens a bit, but continues to move
swiftly to the sea. No boats can move upstream without serious effort.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="gorgon">Gorgon River</A>
</H3>
<P>
Much slower and wider than the Atrek, most traffic uses this branch of the
river. Boats destined for Beogar and from there pass in its wider spots. These
shallow boats are not good for serious seafaring, but suffice in good weather
as long as they follow the coast. 
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="highreach">Highreach River</A>
</H3>
<P>
Swift and narrow, this river races to the sea. By the time it reaches
C&aelig;lwynn, it moves fast enough to turn water wheels and power much of the
city's manufacturing. Only canoes and similar boats can survive the rapids that
occur frequently along its path.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="atiira">Atiira River</A>
</H3>
<P>
Swift but wide, this river handles most of the traffic going from
Hu&aelig;tburg to Alhwick. However, the upward journey is only attempted with
good rowers or magic. Lumber is floated freely down the river, thus causing
travel upstream to be doubly hazardous. Many boats are built in Hu&aelig;tburg,
travel to Alhwick and are dismantled. The parts are put on wagons and then
carried back up over land to Hu&aelig;tburg. There, they are put back together
again for the trip downstream. Effectively, this means that it takes about a
week to travel downstream, but at least two or three weeks to make the return
trip.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="other">Other</A>
</H2>
<H3>
<A NAME="desert">Southern Desert</A>
</H3>
<P>
The desert goes on for miles. Few have ever ventured there, but it is known
that there are human lands on the other side. Every now and then, something or
one turns up in Wayland claiming to be &quot;from the distant south&quot;, and it is
often enough that there must be some truth to it.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="steppes">Nomadic Steppes</A>
</H3>
<P>
Plain grasslands, not very good for cultivating, but excellent grazing land.
They stretch for days to the east, with various tribes of nomads living all
over. Herds of cattle, horses, and buffalo run wild here, followed by the
tribes.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="tunwalch">Tunwalch Bay</A>
</H3>
<P>
It's the same water as in the Kitaran Sea, but the fish here are bigger and
better. A bluish algae grows here, just below the water's surface, and fish
love it. The algae is edible by humans, too, and is eaten as a vegetable in
Telandyr and other surrounding towns. No one knows exactly why it grows here
and nowhere else. The algae doesn't interfere with ships, since it grows from
the sea-bottom up, so it is hardly noticeable except for the blue tint to the
water.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="hyghilde">Hyghilde Peninsula</A>
</H3>
<P>
This rocky arm of the Granos Mountains thrusts all the way into the sea. Almost
twenty miles of land that is one or two miles across, extremely rocky and very
stable. It is high enough that only the very last mile or so is ever covered in
water, so many people live here. The entire peninsula is considered to be part
of H&aelig;dburg, even though the &quot;city proper&quot; sits at the base of the arm.
The peninsula is covered with docks and mooring ropes, with warehouses along
the length. If it had been made by man, it couldn't have been better placed or
set up. Almost every ship in the Kitaran Sea visits here, if only because it's
so easy. (And to get metals from the Granos Mountains.)
