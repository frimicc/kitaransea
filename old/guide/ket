<A NAME="top">Empire of Ket</A>
</H2>
<P>
The oldest country in the area, Ket is a dictatorship. The Emperor holds
absolute power over all citizens of the nation. The Emperor is a powerful mage,
trained from birth into the family tradition. Ket was founded by one of the
first Autarchs, and has been growing for almost 2000 years. In fact, the
current system of dates and years was created by Kethan I (the founder named
his empire after him) and year 1 was the founding of the empire. 
</P>
<P>
Emperor Kethan started many traditions, but the most famous was his
Gladiatorial Combats. Fond of watching men die, the Emperor would command
slaves and criminals (and political opponents) into battle with horrible
monsters, while huge crowds looked on. The Arena in Gothos has been alive with
the sounds of battle since the beginning, with only a few periods of disuse
over the years. Even during the revolutions the Arena drew crowds to watch
their favorite warriors vie for glory.
</P>
<P>
In 1304, the master mage Fistandantus led a successful revolt against the
Emperor at the time, Rashikan III. Within ten years Fistus (the name by which
he is most often known) had managed to completely control the government,
through a series of battles, assassinations, bribes, and power plays. In 1315,
Rashikan III and every member of his house were hunted down and either killed
or forced to participate in the games in the Arena. Rashikan and Fistus faced
off in Maaros, on the 4th of Richfest in 1315, with a battle of magic versus
psionics. When the pyrotechnics were over, Rashikan's rule was no more.
</P>
<P>
Fistus then disbanded the Arena for almost twenty years, before it was
re-opened by public appeals. In the centuries that followed, Fistus's family
was overthrown and later re-took control of the government. Minor civil wars
were fought every few years between 1587 and 1640, as one faction or another
tried to become Emperor. Finally, in 1645, the current ruling family, the
Rythoruus clan, came to power and have stayed there since. There has been no
infighting within the family for generations, due to the aggressive and
rigorous training/brainwashing that each newborn child goes through starting at
age 3. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a slight tendency towards evil Emperors since Kahn Rythoruus
came to power. Because of this, the entire empire has slid slightly towards
more evil alignments. Humanoid tribes (Orcs, goblins, etc.) walk the streets of
Stanas, coming from their homes in the Granos Mountains. to trade with the
Empire. Slavery is legal and thriving in Ket. Many captured Athmyrans and
Nomads are sold on the slave blocks every week. 
</P>
<P>
The general populace tends to be Lawful, living in fear of the militia and the
Emperor's Chosen: The Red Hand. Non-organized crime is rarely seen, but
organized thieves' guilds and mafia hold sway over most merchants and shops in
every city. Crimes that are brought to the attention of the Militia have to
overcome many obstacles before they are even investigated, but freelance
criminals are punished swiftly and severely when caught. 
</P>
<P>
Mages in Ket hold almost all the advisory positions in the government. The
Clergy tends to stay out of politics... for the time being. Bane, Cyric, and
other evil gods are openly worshipped in the larger cities; quietly worshipped
in small farming villages and towns, but Chaotic deities such as Tymora are
frowned upon. Psionics are illegal and hated by the population. When someone
shows any psionic talent (many children are born with wild talents, but most
suppress them), a witch hunt will ensue, with the person's own family helping
to catch and kill the offender. 
</P>
<P>
Regional exports are lumber, fish, and food, with some metals and gems. Most of
the Ketan valley (between the Granos Mountains. and the Blue River) is covered
with small independent farms. Grain and vegetables are grown throughout, but
most fruit comes from groves in the eaves of the Grandwood and Adri Forests.
Also exported are mercenaries and &quot;fine goods&quot; such as silk, furniture, and
other luxuries that can only be produced in a metropolitan society. Imports are
generally slaves, precious metals, exotic items found only in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Local government is loosely Feudal. The Emperor has granted many noble titles,
assuring that anyone with enough money or power is a &quot;Lord&quot;. Much of the
fertile land is partitioned out between Lords of various power levels and
abilities. For example, Lord Kathanos, an experienced warrior and general, owns
many square miles of land outside of Stanas, thus controlling most of the food
and other goods brought overland to the city. Next to Kathanos's lands, Lord
Xavienas, a female mage, owns barely enough land to keep her own family and
slaves fed and clothed. Yet, both rulers bear the same title, &quot;Lord&quot;. 
</P>
<P>
Each Lord can grant some of his land to subordinates. In cases such as Lord
Kathanos, this is a necessity, since one man can only practically control the
lands within a day's ride from his castle. These subordinates are usually
called &quot;Barons&quot;, but there is no standard; each Lord grants whatever titles he
chooses. Barons rule their lands under the complete control of their Lords --
in some cases, they are literally charmed or mind controlled by their Lords. 
</P>
<P>
Barons (or the less powerful Lords) generally control the local population of
peasants and merchants via physical means. &quot;Brute squads&quot; roam the lands,
enforcing the local leader's dictates and collecting taxes from people who
annoy them. This leads the people to become a little paranoid, with an
&quot;everyone is out for themselves&quot; philosophy the most favorite. Peasants have no
power, not even to rise is status, except through marriage. Merchants can (and
sometimes do) move from town to town, Lord to Lord, but the economics are
heavily weighted towards staying in one place. E.g., a merchant would ask
permission to build a blacksmithy. The Lord would grant him materials and
labor, but would expect the merchant to stay a while. If the merchant made any
motions to leave, the Brute Squad would likely beat him up, break his tools,
etc. to &quot;convince&quot; him not to go. Understandably, this can lead to a bit of
class hatred by the peasants.
</P>
<P>
Torture is legal in Ket, as is human sacrifice for organized purposes such as
arena games or religious rituals. The expected way to advance in an office is
to assassinate or discredit your superior. Lords gain land by either convincing
the Emperor to give it to them (and take it away from a neighboring Lord) or by
capturing it by force of arms. The summer is generally known as &quot;campaign
season&quot;, where many Lords hire mercenaries to conscript the local peasants and
make war on their neighbors. In some of the more stable areas, treaties have
been used to make this unnecessary, but those areas just see more of the
political &quot;land-grabbing&quot;. In large cities, the campaign season is usually
marked by a &quot;turf war&quot; between various organized crime groups, each no doubt
led by a &quot;Lord&quot; looking to gain power. 
</P>

<A NAME="gothos">Gothos</A>
</H3>
<P>
The capital city is huge. A sprawling mass of buildings and people, it covers
most of the Athas delta and houses at least 100,000 people. Due to the
marshiness of the area, many buildings are built a few feet above ground level,
with wooden walkways as &quot;roads&quot; connecting them. In some sections of the city,
a person can walk for a mile without seeing the ground. This arrangement, while
not altogether completely stable, allows most people to simply throw their
trash &quot;below&quot;, and the tide will slowly wash it into the sea. Thus, Gothos is
actually a rather clean city. 
</P>
<P>
Richer areas of the city, and larger stone buildings are built with a level or
two under ground, to support the weight. When entering a stone building from a
walkway, a person usually has to step down a few feet to reach the floor of the
first level. In the most expensive areas, such as the Emperor's Palace, the
Arena, and the major temples, stone has been laid down to provide a firm base
for the structures. There are no walkways here, and the stone roads are
well-kept. 
</P>
<P>
Like most places in Ket, Gothos is pretty much run by a few noble houses. They
scheme and plan and combat each other in the streets sometimes, over
disagreements about who knows what. The major players here are: House Palin,
House Gax, House Vorloi (also known as House Vellans, the assassins' house),
House Bilard, and House Perren.
</P>
<P>
The city is also the home of a number of very important temples. Just outside
the city on a hill is the House of the Moon, a huge temple to Selune run by
Naneatha Suaril. In the heart of the city, built upon sculpted pillars and
walkways is the Temple of Beauty, sacred to Sune.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="telos">Telos</A>
</H3>
<P>
This bustling city is partly a merchant center and partly an agricultural
center. Telos is the main stopover for goods (fruit, lumber, mushrooms) from
Maaros on their way to Gothos. The docks on the Athas River are always moving,
day and night. Also, the city's central location makes it the best place to
load farm goods from the central valley on barges for the capital. Telos is
probably the most mercantile city in Ket, and thus allows greater freedoms to
its citizens. More people pass through the city than live there, and in the
winter the population can drop to as few and 10,000 people. 
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="granthar">Granthar</A>
</H3>
<P>
About a day's ride west of Telos, this farming village is home to maybe 300
people. It has one main street, with an Inn, some shops, and homes. Mainly,
this is the physical location of Castle Forlorn, the home of Lord Balzac. He is
a minor lord, and only controls enough land to keep his castle functioning and
to tithe to the church. The castle and village are the home of an experiment in
social engineering: everyone worships Bane, but none of the peasants has been
told the name of their god. They just call him &quot;God&quot;, as if there were only one
deity. This sparks some mighty curious looks from travelers, but as of now no
one has broken the silence that locks this community into worshipping the Black
Lord without question.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="stanas">Stanas</A>
</H3>
<P>
A mining town. As big as a city, Stanas still thinks of itself as a town: very
few cultural events, most people look down on merchants as &quot;freeloaders&quot;,
everything closes at night. However, there are really two sides to this city:
during the day, humans and dwarves conduct business, patrol the streets, and
work in the mines. As soon as the sun goes down, the non-humans come out.
Stanas has a huge proportion of orcs and goblins, possibly up to a quarter of
the population. They tend to conduct business at night, away from the bright
daylight. Thus, all &quot;night shift&quot; work is done by non-humans: mining,
patrolling, etc. Dusk and dawn are when the town is busiest, as meetings
between groups are generally held then.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="alpanas">Alpanas</A>
</H3>
<P>
This is the only small town that the Emperor has ever personally visited. It
guards the border to Beogar over the Granos Mountains. Like Stanas, humanoids
have been allowed to live here in exchange for helping with the
around-the-clock vigilance. Effectively, this is a military base, with a few
brothels and small arena to keep the men happier. Many of the soldiers would
have deserted long ago, except that they are all trained to hate Beogar and
brainwashed to follow orders to the death. It is similar to Sparta, Greece, on
Earth, in these respects.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="maaros">Maaros</A>
</H3>
<P>
Orchards on the edge of the Grandwood, lumber from the Grandwood itself, and
all the various animals and plants that can only grow in old-growth forests are
the main exports from this city. Smaller than the other big cities in Ket,
Maaros claims fame from being the site of the battle between Rashikan and
Fistus in 1315. Thus, this is the Emperor's greatest stronghold. The people
here saw the previous dynasty for what it was (evil and corrupt) and believe
the new dynasty (now almost 600 years old!) has all the answers. Generally
speaking, the people here are a little naive about politics.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="sauthos">Sauthos</A>
</H3>
<P>
Imagine East Berlin. Sauthos is strictly controlled by its current ruler, Lord
Latekos. And Latekos is unhappy about the &quot;twin city&quot; status Sauthos had a mere
100 years ago with Sauter, in Wayland. None-the-less, he cannot stop the
trading between the two cities, or his people would suffer and probably revolt.
As it is, Sauthos is the way in for many goods from arch-enemy states Beogar
and Athmyr, and the way out for goods destined to those places. 
</P>
<P>
There are three bridges between the cities, across the Blue River. At the
Sauthos side, guards are always posted. Only citizens with a pass (given for
life and inherited) can pass through the gates. Others usually meet at the gate
with someone on the other side and pass goods through. Goods transferred
without a pass are taxed a flat 10%, thus making Lord Latekos a very rich man.
Since only citizens of Ket can get a pass, this keeps the population from
suddenly moving to Sauter.
</P>
<P>
In the past (about 100 years ago), there were attempts to take over Sauter from
Sauthos, but they failed. There have been no more outright war for almost 50
years, so people pretty much accept the current state of affairs.
</P>
