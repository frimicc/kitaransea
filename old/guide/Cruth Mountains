</H3>
<P>
Tall mountains protecting the area from the desert winds to the south. They are
inhabited by Mountain dwarves and numbers of humanoids. Giants live in the
farther areas, but have so far stayed away from human towns.

<P>
These mountains contain salt and plenty of stone, but not much in the way of
metals or gems.
