Interesting Facts</A>
</H2>
<P>
Although elves taught humans about magic, about 700 years ago, there is very
little contact between average men and elves. Every mage knows the elves,
however, and for high-level mages, there is no substitute for training and
researching with the elves. They have the best libraries, the best loremasters,
the best teachers. Finding them can be difficult, however...
</P>
<P>
Dwarves, on the other hand, often have contact with humans. Trade in the Granos
Mountains and the Telos Mountains would not occur without dwarves. Thus,
average humans know a lot more about dwarves than elves.
</P>
<P>
Most humans in general are rather skeptical about demi-humans. In some places,
such as Ket, they are treated like Humanoids (in Ket they are generally more
evil, too), while in others they are viewed with suspicion or awe. Many towns
in Beogar, Ket, and Athmyr have never seen an elf or dwarf, and when they pass
through they tend to draw a crowd.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="highelves">High Elves</A>
</H2>
<P>
High Elves live in the Grandwood, the Adri Forest, and some plains areas
bordering the Adri and the Telos Mountains. They are united under the rule of
the Overking, who currently stays on his throne in the Grandwood. The Adri and
surrounding area are ruled by the Underking, who is in constant communication
with the Overking. Generally, the High Elves stick to themselves, but they do
trade with men and have treaties with them. In the Grandwood, the elves allow
Ket to forest the first 10 miles into the forest, but not the old-growth
timber. Boats are allowed to pass through the forest along the Athas River, but
not allowed to go farther than the bank. Often, an elven patrol follows each
boat to make sure that they stay on course. 
</P>
<P>
In the Adri, the elves allow the humans to forest within a day's journey of the
edge (four miles or so), but have reforestation program. For each tree felled
by the humans, two are planted in the same area, to expand the forest over
time. So far, the humans have not noticed that the forest has grown several
miles in the last 600 years. Travel within the forest is denied, however, and
it is assumed that something is going on within its depths.
</P>
<P>
In the Telos foothills, High Elves have built cities on the hills, with stone
buildings and wide streets. These cities are only rarely visited by average
humans, but they are the centers for learning Magic. Huge libraries here hold
the knowledge of nearly twenty generations of elven mages. All mages come here
at some time to study, and usually are teleported in. The cities are
well-hidden from others, and are never seen by the humans living a mere day's
ride away. 
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="woodelves">Wood Elves</A>
</H2>
<P>
Wood Elves are not nearly so nice to men and humankind. In the Ta-Bel'Ran and
the La'nar'ran, the Wood Elves keep the forests virtual jungles of tangled
underbrush and trees. No paths cross through the forest, no roads allow carts
to move through the heavy growth. These elves do not recognize the Overking or
the Underking, and have their own societies. In fact, the two woods hold
slightly different groups. Note that Wood Elves will only speak Elvish, never
Common or other Human tongues.
</P>
<P>
In the Ta-Bel'Ran, the elves allow the humans to forest the edges of the wood.
However, anyone wandering further inside is shot full of arrows and delivered
to his home as a message to other humans. These elves, having been a target of
Autarchs, Ketites and Undead armies, have decided that they will just wait out
the humans, since they will obviously destroy themselves before too long.
They've waited nearly five generations now, and hope it won't be too much
longer.
</P>
<P>
In the La'nar'ran, the elves have been attacked much less often and are a
little more helpful to humans. Several tribes of nomads live near here, in the
edges of the forest, and they are active partners with the elves in
conservation and trade. The elves still value their space highly, though, and
will stop any human from entering &quot;protected&quot; areas. On the other side of the
forest, the elves have seen the guerrilla fighting that goes on around the Emba
Veda, and have taken a harder hand in things. Evil beings in the area suddenly
disappear, while good creatures can even wander into the forest and wander out
unharmed -- often missing a day or two's memories, though. Humans in this area
don't believe there are elves in the wood, but that it is a &quot;dark and menacing&quot;
place.

<A NAME="hilldwarves">Hill Dwarves</A>
</H2>
<P>
Hill Dwarves live in Beogar, in the hills around the Oidillaf and in
Ket/Wayland, in the hills around the Telos Mountains. The two groups have very
little contact with each other, but messages are sometimes passed between them.
</P>
<P>
Hill Dwarves in Beogar tend to be very open. They live in towns that see quite
a bit of human traffic, or even in human towns. Mostly they follow the laws of
Beogar, but don't usually worship Tyr. This has caused some concern in Alhwick,
but not enough to cause problems yet. Dwarves help the humans in mining,
construction, and other crafts at which the dwarves excel. There are some
secrets kept from the humans, but none of importance.
</P>
<P>
In the Telos area, the Hill Dwarves are much more numerous and generally live
in their own cities. They are ruled by a king, and have a long history in the
area. They are on good terms with the High Elves (as good as can be expected
between Dwarves and Elves), and often trade with them. These Hill Dwarves see
humans as an incursion and have already told some groups to &quot;get lost&quot; when
they tried to farm some nearby lands. The largest city is at the head of the
Emba Veda, using Water Power to run some of the largest mines and forges.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="mtndwarves">Mountain Dwarves</A>
</H2>
<P>
In the deep mountains, dwarves live differently. Mountain Dwarves live on the
edge of the Underdark, generally in underground complexes connected to the
surface and other conclaves via long tunnels. These dwarves don't worry much
about the humans or elves, because they have their hands full with the
Underdark. So, they are much more of a mystery to humans. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain Dwarves live in the hearts of the Granos Mountains, the Cruth
Mountains, and the Telos Mountains. Each group is separate, with various clans
living almost completely separately from the others. These dwarves trade with
other dwarves or humans for necessary food and &quot;living goods&quot;, but not much
else. They tend to be isolationist from the surface world.
</P>
<P>
One such clan is the KurrinKarm Clan, who live in the Granos Mountains not far
from Hu&aelig;tburg. They send trade emissaries to the town every other month,
with goods to trade and a list of goods to bring back. No human from the town
has yet to visit their caverns, and they would like to keep it that way.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="karagun">Kar-agun</A>
</H3>
<P>
This is the stronghold of the KurrinKarm Clan. It was founded in year 3290
after the fall of the sky (Ket year 1169) and has been trying to repossess the
Granos Mountains from the evil that lurks there for two generations. It is a
Secondary Stronghold, but is self-sufficient. The over 400 dwarves living here
cover the gamut of skills and clans. Duke Gonbard (F8) has ruled wisely since
the death of his father, Duke Brokmin, 200 years ago. Every occupant is in the
militia, and there is almost constant fighting for ground in the Granos
Mountains' Underdark. Due to the warfare, these dwarves are understandably
cautious about visitors, especially non-good ones. 
</P>
<P>
The militia is commanded by General Atholgrom (F7) and his lieutenants. In
addition to the normal dwarves, there are some forty &quot;special forces&quot;
classified troops in the stronghold. 
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="halflings">Halflings</A>
</H2>
<P>
Interestingly enough, only Hairfoot Halflings are found in the Kitaran Sea
area. They all live in a shire on the border between Athmyr and Wayland.
Originally Athmyr claimed the land and the halflings paid taxes to the King.
Now, the shire has seceded to Wayland, and sends a representative to the
council in Nethathon. Basically, though, they live their own lives the way they
always have.
</P>
<P>
The fields in the area are bountiful and produce more than enough to feed the
entire shire. They elect a Sheriff when they want to, and get rid of one when
he wants to retire. There isn't any overriding foreign policy or such things,
since halflings have little use for government. Each person takes care of
himself and things all work out. It's a very peaceful place for the few
thousand halflings living there, and they really don't want to move or take
over more space -- just to be left alone. Generally, that is what happens.<P>
One note: the military in Wayland features a company of Halfling scouts, mostly
slingers, thieves, and rangers. Since Military service is not mandatory in the
Halfling Shire, this company tends to grow or shrink depending on conditions in
the Halfling home area.
