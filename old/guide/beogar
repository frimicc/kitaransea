<A NAME="top">Kingdom of Beogar</A>
</H2>
<P>
Beogar is a feudal monarchy. Founded in 1550, after the local Autarchs were
overthrown with undead warriors, the mage leading the assault, Siegric,
declared himself King over all the lands from the Highreach to the Granos
Mountains. At the time, everyone was grateful that their wartime-rescuer took
the reins of government with a firm hand... It wasn't until 1599 that his
subjects realized that Siegric had become a lich!
</P>
<P>
A period of civil war followed, with the priests of Tyr, Lathander, and all the
good deities leading various drives against the undead legions of Siegric. The
peasants were surrounded by war and death on all sides until the final months
of 1670, when the citadel at Oswald fell. Oswald had commanded the mouth of the
Highreach for ages, and was the last refuge of Siegric. The castle was renamed
C&aelig;lwynn by the victorious troops and became a beacon of light and truth
in the land. 
</P>
<P>
It took until 1674 to finish off the last of the undead legions, destroying the
leaders or driving them into the Oidillaf. Peace returned to the Kingdom.
Coenbern, the priest of Tyr who was the Lord High General at the battle of
Oswald, declared himself King over Beogar -- the embattled lands. While many
faithful clerics and priests had led the militias and mercenary troops during
the civil war, Coenbern was the only one with the political &quot;clout&quot; to manage
to stay King. A few years later, everybody forgot the whole argument... 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, the King and family have always been followers of Tyr,
although they are no longer priests. The worship of Tyr is the state religion;
no other deities can be worshipped, not even the other &quot;good&quot; ones. Beogar is a
deeply religious nation. Clerics are revered by all, and many laws are slanted
in their favor. Some Athmyrans say, &quot;The king of Beogar may not be a priest,
but the churches run the country.&quot;
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is small, claiming lands far to the west, but only controlling the
area within a hundred miles of the coast. Farming is difficult in the rolling
hills, and many peasants barely make enough to feed their families after paying
their taxes and tithes. This leads them into debt to their lord, becoming serfs
-- tied to the land, working forever and never getting out of the hole. But
many don't mind; after a few generations, no one remembered what it was like to
live any other way. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the church of Tyr runs the country. There are no taxes, but everyone
is expected to tithe to the Church. The Church's army, the Templars, provide
the physical muscle to back up church edicts. Technically, the King is in
control, but really he is a pawn of the church. The church is led by &quot;The Hand
of Tyr on Earth&quot;, the highest ranking Lawgiver. The &quot;Hand&quot; is generally
accepted as the avatar of Tyr, and his crusades against evil humanoids,
Bane-worshipping Ketites, and mindwitches seem to have the power of Tyr behind
them. 
</P>
<P>
Local lords are the law in their regions, sized from a few square miles to
everything within a day's ride of the castle. Lords protect their peasants and
receive taxes and food from them. Each lord has made an oath of fealty to a
more powerful lord, promising troops in time of war and taxes other times. This
goes up a few levels to the king himself. Most of these small baronies,
duchies, counties, etc. are unremarkable, but two deserve greater attention.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="blackhawk">Barony of Blackhawk</A>
</H3>
<P>
This is a very recent barony, carved out of the wilderness in the Granos
Mountains. The baron, &AElig;thelbrand, was only 25 -- very young for such
power. His ambition was always to rule, but since he was a third son, he could
not count on even receiving a small portion of his father's lands. So, he
requested and received permission to expand the boundaries of Beogar; to settle
the upper reaches of the Atiira River. This area was utter wilderness, home to
marauding bands of humanoids and giants. &AElig;thelbrand and his loyal
henchmen traveled up the river and founded Hu&aelig;tburg in a valley near the
source of the river. 
</P>
<P>
From 1890 to 1895, the intrepid group cleared land, built walls, and managed to
hold the evils at bay long enough to start a village. Since then Hu&aelig;tburg
has grown into a small town, with a wooden wall around it. The castle was
completed in Wealsun, 1899. Most inhabitants are involved in mining and logging
the surrounding slopes, sending the fruits of their labor downstream to
Alhwick. Most of the day-to-day supplies are brought upstream during the long,
hard return trip. 
</P>
<P>
Now, this would be a bold undertaking already, but there is another thing:
&AElig;thelbrand does not worship Tyr. He believes that people should be free
to choose any deity to worship. This has not gone unnoticed by the Grand Duke
in Alhwick, but as long as Blackhawk doesn't grow too fast and keeps sending
silver from the mountains to him, he is prepared to overlook the upstart's
breach of morals...
</P>
<P>
During mid-1899, this barony gained some attention when it discovered two
important items: First, an old Monastery in the mountains above the town was
discovered to be inhabited by worshippers of Bane -- the hated enemy of Tyr. A
force was put together to destroy the evil beings, and succeeded in clearing
them out of the Monastery. The structure was rebuilt into a new monastery, and
monks from Alhwick brought in to inhabit it. A strange explosion and fire
destroyed the place a few weeks later, thus bringing into doubt whether or not
the evil was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The second item was the discovery of &quot;a ruby the size of your fist&quot;, worth an
estimated 50,000 gold pieces. However this find by a group of adventurers is
unconfirmed and may just be wishful thinking. It has brought quite a few
adventurers to the area, though.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="ferth">Ferth</A>
</H3>
<P>
A small town on the land trail from Alhwick to Theodward, this place has a town
wall, but very little else. There is an open-air market every Sunday, where the
population doubles due to the incoming farmers and their families. As a
traveler's town, it has more inns than a town this size normally would.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="theodward">Theodward</A>
</H3>
<P>
&quot;The gate in the mountains.&quot; Theodward is more of a large, permanent military
base than it is a town. Yet, there are enough non-soldiers here to have created
a reasonable-sized town. There are inns and taverns, stables, barracks,
smithies, and merchants, but everyone is related to the army presence. 
</P>
<P>
The town was founded after the last war with Ket, about 200 years ago. A state
of &quot;cold war&quot; existed for a long time between Beogar and Ket, and Theodward and
Alpanas were set up to &quot;watch the fence&quot;, so to speak. The border between the
countries was settled to be the ridge line of the Granos Mountains -- of
course, that isn't a very specific point, so both countries decided to police
the area. Effectively, no one can travel between Theodward and Alpanas; the two
bases are still dedicated to keeping the border &quot;safe&quot;.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="grimwald">Duchy of Grimwald</A>
</H3>
<P>
Grimwald was a powerful man. Even when he was just a count, the king could tell
that Grimwald desired the throne. So, when it came time to promote him to Duke,
he was asked to move to H&aelig;dburg -- a major trading port on the Hyghilde
Peninsula, but far away from C&aelig;lwynn. The new duke realized the
significance of his duchy and decided not to make any moves for the throne.
That was in 1700. 
</P>
<P>
Since Grimwald's death, his family continues to harbor some resentment for
being pushed out to &quot;the boondocks&quot;. Ignoring the fact that the Duchy is one of
the most prosperous in the kingdom, because of its strategic location at the
narrowest point of the Kitaran Sea. Ships from Athmyr and Wayland often cross
from Telandyr to H&aelig;dburg instead of following the much longer coastal
route to C&aelig;lwynn. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the Duke of Grimwald is so busy scheming for power, that he lets the
city government lapse. Court is held only once or twice a month, and even then
only the most influential courtiers can get an audience. In the meantime, the
city tries to run itself. This leads to anarchy during the winter months, when
sailors are stuck onshore waiting for the winds to change, so that they can
sail to Telandyr. Fights in the dockside areas are common, and the duke will
not spend &quot;one more copper&quot; on watchmen for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the lawful nature of the population tends to keep the city
functioning during periods of inattention, but sometimes this is not enough.
Several times in the past years, rioting and looting has filled the streets of
H&aelig;dburg, set off by otherwise minor events. Understandably, the local
watchmen and merchant guilds are extremely wary of newcomers, especially
sailors. This internal strife merely adds to the problems presented by
humanoids in the nearby Granos Mountains. Rumors are beginning to circulate
that the guilds may ask the king to replace the duke...
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="alhwick">Alhwick</A>
</H3>
<P>
The Holy See of Alhwick; home of The Hand of Tyr on Earth; Center of the Faith.
The city's full title tells it all. This large city, at the mouth of the Atiira
River, was originally a popular trading port. However, once the Kingdom of
Beogar was established and the &quot;Hand&quot; chose to make his palace here, it was
never the same. Insular and paranoid, the church permits only the faithful to
enter the city. So, the docks were moved to the other side of the river to keep
out &quot;the heathen riff-raff&quot;. Most trading goods that flow to the city never
leave -- the church is a great consumer, with huge temples and great golden
altars scattered about. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its location, much of Beogar's farmed goods have to move through
Alhwick on their way to H&aelig;dburg or foreign ports. However, the current
church decree lets little leave the country. Most of the food and other goods
(silver and lumber from the Granos Mountains, sheep and livestock from the
hills surrounding the city) is used to keep the large contingent of religious
leaders well-fed. Very few starve in Alhwick... because it looks bad. The
starving are thrown out of the city to find work on nearby farms or ranches.
</P>
<P>
The city is beautiful, though. Trees line the avenues; streets are wide enough
for carriages; everywhere one looks there is beautiful architecture, leading
the eye toward the heavens. The &quot;Palace of the Hand&quot; is the most wonderful of
all, containing terraced gardens, huge arches and stained glass windows, and
sculpture depicting the best scenes from Beogar's and Tyr's history.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="caelwynn">C&aelig;lwynn</A>
</H3>
<P>
The Royal city is not quite as splendid as Alhwick, but much bigger. Reachable
only by boat or mule, the city perches high above the foothills, with a
commanding view of the Highreach River and the whole of the South Kitaran Sea.
On a clear day, you can almost see Telandyr; most of the time you can see the
glinting from Alhwick, north along the coast. In the 225 years since the city
was named, it has changed from a military fortress into a terraced city, home
to 20,000 people or more. It has spread from one small hilltop into several
miles of lanes and roads, on both sides of the river, all leading up to the
King's Castle.
</P>
<P>
The city thrives on the mining in the Cruth Mountains and the Oidillaf,
although more the former than the latter. &quot;Civilization&quot; follows the coast to
the east for many miles, but only five days mule ride inland (about twenty
miles). Mules bred here are among the most sure-footed in the world. Most trade
is held with Athmyr, along the coast, but some goods (and tithes) are collected
in central Beogar and brought here to the King. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the evils that were removed from the land during the countries
formation fled south into the Oidillaf. For that reason, the King wanted to be
sure that his most powerful warriors were waiting at the mouth of the Highreach
when those evils decided to return. C&aelig;lwynn contains the main army
training ground for Beogar, and the nearer Oidillaf is constantly scoured for
any possible threat. So far, only some humanoids and giants have caused any
trouble here, but everyone waits for the day when the Autarchs will sail down
the river at the head of an army...
</P>
<P>
This position near the Oidillaf has led to a large number of adventurers coming
through the city. After a while, the King organized the Bureau of Adventurer's
Information, run by Lord Khelben. Unfortunately, the old lord is a bit daft and
mischevious. He has staffed the bureau almost entirely with worshippers of
Leira, goddess of deception. Thus, while sometimes a visit to the bureau
headquarters will reveal invaluable information, most of the time it leads to
riddles and outright falsehoods.
</P>
