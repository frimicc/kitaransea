<A NAME="Story56">Fifty-sixth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Planting 24 - Flocktime 3, 1900:
</P>
<P>
The treasure was split up between our heroes. Zachery took part of his share, a 6,000gp cloak broach, and sent it with his weekly letter to Faustus. Hygulf and Skeeve were aghast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zachery met with the messenger who was waiting for him in Hu&aelig;tburg. The message was from his father, in Gothos, saying that he was finally willing to meet with Zachery after their long falling out. Zachery responded, saying he would be in Gothos within a week -- with a very large mount that would require stabling...
</P>
<P>
Speaking of stabling, Zachery also spoke with Baron Blackhawk about building some sort of stable for Dhak (the Red Dragon with the brain of a mouse) using public funds. The Baron agrees to allow Zachery to build his own stable near Hu&aelig;tburg, because of the jobs it will create, but suggests that Zachery find and hire an accountant who will take care of all the legal and monetary matters involved. The Baron recommends &quot;Hu&aelig;tman&quot;, an accountant in Alhwick.
</P>
<P>
Finally back at the cave, Zachery sees that Hygulf and Skeeve have managed to clean the place up. They got rid of all the extra junk that was in the dragon's lair by wormholing it into a pool of lava. Afterward, the two decided that they wanted to use psionics to take the skin off of Dhak in small pieces, to make armor, but without killing him. Zachery isn't quite as amiable to this plan, but will allow it if the other two will help him teach Dhak to fly!
</P>
<P>
After laughing at the thought and then realizing Zachery was serious, they all came up with a plan. Zachery found a perfect place for test flights: a cliff which stands about 300 feet above a lake, far from any human habitation. Zachery and Dhak stay at the top,
while Hygulf and Skeeve trot down to the lake level for a better view. Dhak jumped off the cliff three times before he finally managed to stay aloft and not crash into the water. He was flying!! For the next trick, Hygulf bought a sheep from a local dwarven shepherd, which Dhak tried to pick up in a swoop. Well... he nearly crashed, but in the end learned how to catch prey and feed himself.
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Zachery and Dhak took off on their journey to Gothos. Hygulf and Skeeve decided to go see the dwarves and find an armorer who would make their dragon-scale armor. As they entered Karagun, the dwarf home, our heroes noticed that the pile of orcs in the main hall was very nearly at the top of the pole. The dwarf guard said that only a few more days were needed to meet the goal. Duke Gonbard of the dwarves invited our heroes to stay and join in the festivities when the pile was finished. Our heroes decided that they would come back for the feast.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf and Skeeve traded some items to the dwarves: the Battle Axe and WarHammer for a ring of invisibility, the FlameTongue sword for a ring of feather falling, and various coins and small gems for larger ones. They also made a deal with an armorer: if they would give the armorer enough dragon scales for one suit of armor, he would make them three. What a deal!
</P>
<P>
The next day, Hygulf and Skeeve wormholed to C&aelig;lwynn to talk to the king. They gave the king his amount in taxes plus an extra gem. (They also returned the gems they borrowed from his girlfriend without his knowledge.) Finally, our heroes met with some interesting news from the Network: the Mayor of Selenica was back in Selenica -- and probably still under the influence of Costanza...
</P>
<P>
Be here next time when we find out why Zachery's father disowned him! Why the Mayor of Selenica is back! Why the King of Beogar is acting strangely...

<A NAME="Story57">Fifty-seventh Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Flocktime 3-5, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes were split this entire meeting: Hygulf and Skeeve were in C&aelig;lwynn and Zachery was just outside Gothos, at his father's house. First we'll follow Hygulf and Skeeve, and then check in on Zachery's doings.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf and Skeeve began by examining the two treasure maps they had found. One looked like it detailed the area around the dragon's hoard that they already plundered, while the other appeared to be a map to a new dragon's hoard -- unguarded, at that! However, following treasure maps was left until a later date...
</P>
<P>
Skeeve finally contacted the assassin again, to see if she had turned up anything on Banites trying to kill him, the hero of Gothos. *smirk* She arranged to meet him and Hygulf at the Royal Church of Tyr near the castle, that afternoon. Hygulf and Skeeve went there immediately and learned from Eadbad, the high priest, that there was a wedding taking place that evening, so they should be quiet. Preparations were almost complete for the wedding of the nobleman Tilwel and his lovely young bride, Friamy. Tilwel is a distinguished man, because he owns almost 3,000 acres of farmland near C&aelig;lwynn.
</P>
<P>
Shortly, a young woman came into the church, obviously the blushing bride. She sat down next to our heroes and they realized it was really the assassin! She quickly imparted that she hadn't found any assassins hired to kill Skeeve. However, the Banites were trying to stir up a <I>Jihad</I>... where every Banite swears to kill on sight the designated enemy, or die trying... Skeeve was not pleased. In return for the information, all she asked was a trip to Telandyr - as fast as possible - the next morning. Hygulf augmented this with his own gift, a 5,000gp gem! The assassin looked puzzled at his gracious gift, but accepted it with a smile.
</P>
<P>
At dawn, Hygulf and Skeeve met the assassin, still dressed in her wedding gown, at the doors of the church. With all haste, Skeeve opened a wormhole to Telandyr and the assassin stepped through with thanks. Moments later, a group of castle guards ran around the corner and questioned our heroes if they had seen "a young woman, dressed for a wedding, run past. She is armed and dangerous..."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zachery landed at his father's estate outside Gothos. Dhakgababdorblad drew <B>lots</B> of stares from the house slaves... after some convincing, one of the stables was cleared out, so the giant riding beast could have somewhere to sleep. Zachery's father was impressed with the tame dragon, but needed more convincing that Zachery was ready to give up his &quot;childish&quot; ways.
</P>
<P>
After a long talk, Zachery's father decided that he would re-consider banning Zachery from the family tree if he would use his powers to help futher the family's position in Ket. Once that was decided, Metellus commenced with the plan to reel Zachery back in. First, he would need to be married to a good Ketite woman... Zachery, mind racing, countered that he was already married! He was married to... yeah, that's it... an assassin!
</P>
<P>
Be here next week, when we find out what the assassin thinks of &quot;playing wife&quot;, whether the Banites are really after Skeeve, and what is going on with the Network!
