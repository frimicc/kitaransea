<A NAME="Story44">Forty-fourth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Fireseek 3-13, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes began this meeting running from possible enemies, and ended 
it waiting
for the possible enemies to come to them. Exciting, as usual!
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Hygulf, Skeeve, and Ongen wormhole from the shores of 
the
Tunwalch bay to C&aelig;lwynn. There, they find Zachery and discover that he 
hasn't had
much luck in coaxing information from the Mayor of Selenica, nor in 
removing
Costanza's domination of him. However, Hygulf worries that Costanza may 
already be
searching for his lost pawn and tries to have him moved to a 
scrying-proof room...
unfortunately, there aren't any in the castle.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Zachery manages to un-dominate the Mayor. They discuss a number 
of
options, but the Mayor worries that it would be too dangerous for him to 
go talk to the
Wayland Assembly. He believes that Costanza would rather murder him 
outright than
let him tell what was happening in Selenica to people with power. So, 
our heroes
contact the Network and they send a courier (named Delilah, who is found 
to be
Lawful-Good) to take him to a safe place.
</P>
<P>
Now paranoia sets in. Our heroes worry that even they themselves could 
have been
dominated, and especially anyone who has met with Costanza in private, 
including the
new King of Beogar! Zachery receives permission to probe the King, and 
finds that he
had met with Costanza, but the memory of the meeting had been mindwiped 
from
him! Once the memory is recovered, the King realizes that Costanza had 
tried to
dominate him, but since he is a psionicist, it didn't work. *whew* Our 
heroes are still
worried about their Network connections, though, since they don't know 
*who* has
been seeing Costanza...
</P>
<P>
On a side note, Hygulf's plan to produce antidotes to various poisons 
receives
enthusiastic support from the King and Eadbad, the court priest of Tyr. 
2000gp are
given to Hygulf to finance the initial cost of the poisons, which he 
will train his body to
produce antidotes for and then deliver some of the antidotes to the 
King. Zachery
contacts the Assassin, but she is busy (?!) in Grimwald. She plans to 
meet Hygulf in
Hu&aelig;tburg in 4 days.
</P>
<P>
So, our heroes go to Hu&aelig;tburg. First thing they probe Master Brand, 
looking for any
taint of corruption. With none found, they know that they can trust him 
and begin to
plan their next moves.
</P>
<P>
A week passes. Skeeve trains for the next level with Master Brand and 
Hygulf spends
some quality time with Shalinar, who had been left at home for the last 
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
While hunting, Hygulf comes across a group of 10 Ketite soldiers on the 
path to
Hu&aelig;tburg! He talks with them, mainly through Selin, who speaks 
Beogarish. Selin
explains that they are going to meet peaceably with the Baron Blackhawk, 
but does
not say why. Hygulf also learns some information about Alpanas: the 
troops there are
led by General Farcourt, under the watchful eye of Vizier Erdun. Leaving 
the group
quickly, Hygulf runs to tell the Baron of their coming.
</P>
<P>
The next day when the Ketites arrive, the Baron allows them an immediate 
audience.
Selin tells the Baron that three whole companies of troops in Alpanas 
are bored,
annoyed with their leaders, and tired of war. They want to defect to 
Beogar. The
Baron meets with his advisors and our heroes, but no decision is made 
tonight.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="Story45">Forty-fifth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Fireseek 14-16, 1900:
</P>
<P>
In the morning, our heroes examine the Ketite troops. Skeeve probes the 
spokesman,
Selin, and discovers that the defecting companies are being led by 
Nethoc, a division
commander. He is a big, black-haired man who is very charismatic. Selin, 
at least,
truly wants to defect, but it is obvious that he is also partly just 
following Nethoc's
plan...
</P>
<P>
Skeeve contacts the King of Beogar to see what his opinion of the 
situation is. The
King wants to meet with the Baron immediately, to discuss their options. 
So, our
heroes go to the Baron and explain, &quot;We're going to take you to see the 
King. Now.
Don't ask how we are going to get there, you really don't want to know.&quot; 
Then they all
wormhole to C&aelig;lwynn. 
</P>
<P>
The Baron and the King meet for a couple of hours, even though it is 
practically the
middle of the night. When they finish, the King tells our heroes that 
they are in charge
of dealing with the Ketite troops: if the troops really want to defect, 
let them. Give
them some land and let them be in peace. However, if they are an 
invading force, it
will be up to our heroes to stop them... The Baron will help our heroes 
in any way
possible.
</P>
<P>
So, our heroes take the Baron back to Hu&aelig;tburg. Since it is still very 
late, they take
their leave of the Baron and return to Hygulf's shop for some rest. 
Unfortunately, the
shop has been ransacked again! Some minor stuff is missing, but not all 
the important
things. Our heroes immediately pick up the trail of the thief (Shalinar 
can smell him)
and follow the tracks of human boot prints out of the shop, out the 
North gate of the
town and a couple of miles down the road to a small logging camp.
</P>
<P>
In the logging camp, one cabin has a light on: inside are two goblins 
dividing up the
loot from Hygulf's shop! Hygulf jumps in, kills one instantly, and 
knocks the other one
unconscious. Zachery probes the still living goblin and realizes that 
these poor
creatures just bought the stuff from the real thief, a human. Zachery 
contacts the thief
and tries to get a sight link, but misses it and becomes blind for four 
hours. Skeeve
manages to connect with a sight link to the thief and realizes that the 
thief is standing
in a nearby cabin watching them! So, Skeeve and Zachery put Invincible 
foes and
Phobia Amplification on the thief while Hygulf crosses the ground 
between the cabins
in two steps and knocks the thief out cold. Since our heroes were really 
worn out at
this point, they tie up the thief and wormhole back to Hygulf's shop.
</P>
<P>
Zachery probes the thief: He is evil, just a thief, and stole from 
Hygulf simply because
he had the opportunity. He gives up the names of the leaders of the 
local Thieves'
Guild: the head is Grimdornok, the second in command is known as Bag, 
and the third
in command is called Bull. After the probe, the thief is allowed to wake 
up and our
heroes bargain with him for his life and equipment. In the end, the 
thief gives Zachery
his magical hand crossbow and pays Hygulf 7500gp to get his stuff back. 
Then the
thief runs out of the shop, presumably to tell the other thieves to stay 
away from it.
Skeeve immediately time trips back to pay his previous load from 
himself, putting the
gold in a small chest in Master Brand's closet. 
</P>
<P>
With that busy night, you might think that our heroes would take the 
next day off, but it
would not be true. At noon, they teleport to a hillside just outside of 
Alpanas. There
they see that the town is really a military base, with *lots* of 
soldiers and a few
support people. Skeeve goes scouting, using Astral Travel to get into 
town and close
enough to Nethoc to probe him. Skeeve discovers that Nethoc is plotting 
to lead the
troops halfway to Hu&aelig;tburg and then tell them that they should really 
attack the town
and be great heroes back home in Ket!!!! He believes that no one else 
knows about
the plan but himself, but he thinks that the other three division 
commanders may have
an idea that something is going on. 
</P>
<P>
With that info, our heroes immediately teleport back to Hu&aelig;tburg and 
talk with the
Baron and the King!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="Story46">Forty-sixth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Fireseek 17-27, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes devise a great plan to handle the supposedly defecting Ketite 
troops:
Skeeve will switch personalities with Nethoc and then continue to lead 
the troops to
defect, instead of having them &quot;change their minds&quot; and attack 
Hu&aelig;tburg! He will lead
them to the abandoned and ruined monastery outside of town, where they 
can stay for
a while until their loyalty can be proven. 
</P>
<P>
So, preparations are made during the week it takes the messengers to 
return from
Hu&aelig;tburg to Alpanas. Hygulf makes some poison antidotes and sends 4 of 
them to
Eadbad, via a wormhole. Skeeve gathers information about Nethoc and his 
troops. He
finds:
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
in Alpanas, there are 4 divisions, each with a Division Commander
</LI>
<LI>
Each division has 5 captains and 25 lieutenants, plus 500 regular 
soldiers
</LI>
<LI>
only three of Nethoc's captains and their 300 troops are deserting, 
the others will
stay in Alpanas.
</LI>
<LI>
one of Nethoc's captains knows how to resist psionic intrusion! 
Luckily, he is not one
of the three who will be deserting.
</LI>
<LI>
Skeeve probes Nethoc carefully about his plans and how he will deal 
with the 6
Ketite guard posts on the way to Hu&aelig;tburg.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Additionally, our heroes prepare a location in the dungeon of C&aelig;lwynn. 
Two cells
together are found, with a barred window in between. Skeeve goes into 
one cell, and
the King explains to the guards that he has a horrible mental disease 
that makes him
think that he is trapped in another person's body. The guards are not to 
let Skeeve out
for any reason and only Hygulf or Zachery should go down to see him.
</P>
<P>
On the final day, Nethoc and the troops leave Alpanas at nightfall. They 
march
through the night and into the day, meeting the first two guard posts. 
At each one,
Nethoc talks to the commander of the post (each containing 10 men) and 
argues with
him about why they are deserting. Nethoc's plan is to let the guards 
convince him that
deserting is wrong, by about the fifth guard post and then he will tell 
his troops that
they are going to attack Hu&aelig;tburg instead. 
</P>
<P>
So, as soon as the army stops marching the next night, Hygulf teleports 
Nethoc to the
cell in C&aelig;lwynn. Skeeve switches personalities with him and teleports 
back to the
army to take Nethoc's place in Nethoc's body. In the morning, Skeeve 
begins his
charade with the troops. He meets with the first guard post and 
successfully ignores
their pleas. At the second guard post of the day, Skeeve/Nethoc is 
startled by one of
the guards saying, &quot;But wait! I thought we had a deal!&quot; Skeeve/Nethoc 
gives orders
that all future guards are to be bound and gagged before they can bother 
him -- the
troops obey without question.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Hygulf goes to C&aelig;lwynn and talks with Nethoc, in 
Skeeve's body.
Nethoc/Skeeve has a poor initial reaction to the situation, but manages 
to calm down
quickly. Hygulf knows that Nethoc/Skeeve is plotting to escape or at 
least gather some
information about his whereabouts, but Hygulf will do his best to thwart 
these moves. 
</P>
<P>
Be here next time when Skeeve/Nethoc leads the troops to Hu&aelig;tburg, 
Nethoc/Skeeve
pulls whatever he can out of his sleeve, and we hope that our heroes can 
get this
whole situation resolved before Nethoc/Skeeve fails too many 
constitution checks and
Skeeve's body dies!!!
</P>
