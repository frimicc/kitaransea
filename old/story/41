Reaping 16 - 19, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes really decided to take on the current inhabitants of Castle Earnsige.
</P>
<P>
First, they wormholed back to Castle Coensige to gather their forces:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Lord Eadbalth of Coensige offered his Wizard, Priest of Lathander, and 30 men</LI>
<LI>Bernden offered Selcourt, a Telekineticist, and Folcton, a Telepath</LI>
<LI>Skeeve and Hygulf themselves, and the Assassin</LI>
</UL>
<P>
With those forces, arrayed against 70 men and two psionicists, our heroes decided to try diplomacy again. Skeeve reconnoitered astrally and found one of the psionicists was asleep, with the other one on guard. Skeeve contacted him and suggested that the brigands should leave the castle peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the psionicist suggested &quot;non-enhanced&quot;, single combat with Castle Earnsige as the prize. If he won, our heroes would go away and quit bothering the castle. If Hygulf or Skeeve won, the brigands would walk away and not bother our heroes again. But, it would have to be &quot;non-enhanced&quot; combat: no psionics involved.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve talked it over with Hygulf and they agreed. This proposal would likely save the lives of at least most of the men and definitely would not harm the castle structurally. So, Skeeve told the other psionicist that they would do it. All parties were to meet within a few hours in Castle Earnsige's courtyard for the combat.
</P>
<P>
Combat! In the courtyard, Hygulf squared off against the psionicist leader, Lillangwel. His lieutenant, Donnamy, stood and watched, along with the entire garrison surrounding our heroes... Things initially looked even-matched, but it soon became apparent that Lillangwel could not pierce Hygulf's Red Dragon-scale armor. Hygulf, on the other hand, had only minor trouble getting past the other's defenses. In only a few minutes it was over: Lillangwel surrendered, to save his life.
</P>
<P>
Even more surprising, the brigands kept their end of the bargain. Lillangwel asked for one day to gather their things and leave and Hygulf granted it. The psionicists disappeared into the keep and our heroes took a tour of their new castle. 
</P>
<P>
First stop: the dungeon. Skeeve released the only prisoner, who introduced herself as &quot;Madame Mim&quot;. She told her story, when pressed: She was a travelling fortune-teller who was passing through Earnsige. She presented herself at the castle and offered to tell fortunes for lodging. Junden, the mage, accepted, but did not like his fortune and imprisoned her in the dungeon. Best of all, it seems now that her fortune had been correct!
</P>
<P>
Next, the troops. The Guard Captain, a man named Felden, told Hygulf that he would like to stay with the castle instead of leaving with the psionicists. He also said that many of his men would like to stay. They all had families living in the town Earnsige now and did not want to uproot them so quickly. Hygulf thanked Felden for his generous offer and told him that he and any of the men who wanted to stay would be welcome to keep their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Third, the town. Hygulf and Skeeve walked from the castle to the town and called a meeting of the elders. At the meeting, they heard about how the men in the castle were rather good to the town: bringing in luxury goods from trade (?), not taking any taxes, protecting them from the orcs and any marauding neighbors, and even letting the troops help out with building projects and clearing the roads. Hygulf explained that he did not see any reason for those policies to change. As the new Lord, he and Skeeve would continue to protect, supply, and grow the town. Also, he talked about the possibility that the town and castle might become an important trade destination, which would cause some trouble initially, but would soon be the best thing that ever happened to the place. The elders welcomed him, but seemed like they would wait and see if he followed through on his promises.
</P>
<P>
Back in the castle, our heroes planned a celebratory feast for three days' time. They invited Lord Eadbalth and his house to attend, but privately asked if they could borrow some of his kitchen staff to prepare the feast. Lord Eadbalth agreed to both requests. Skeeve then contacted the King of Beogar and invited him to join them. He, too, agreed, but said that he was rather busy and would only be able to attend the dinner itself. Skeeve thought that was fine, but asked him to think about granting amnesty to the troops who decided to stay and work for Beogar now. King Hrethrew said he would think about it.
</P>
<P>
So, in three days' time, a great feast was held in Castle Earnsige. All the townsfolk were there and all the remaining troops. The leaders of Castle Coensige also attended, as did the King himself. The former owners of the castle, the psionicists and brigands, had left without a fuss on time and thus there was no mention of them. The King granted amnesty for the remaining troops and told them of their new duties to Beogar: defend the crown, the faith of Tyr, and the people of the country. And all were happy.
</P>
<P>
Be here next time as we see the return of Faustus!
