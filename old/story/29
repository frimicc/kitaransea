Wealsun 16 - 18, 1900:
</P>
<P>
As soon as Hygulf and Skeeve had rested, our heroes resumed their journey through the Astral Plane... only to discover that their destination was mere minutes away! They had rested only a short distance from their goal. Isn't that the way it always works?
</P>
<P>
They passed through the color portal and reappeared in the Kitaran Sea region several miles outside of C&aelig;lwynn. A quick teleport and they were back in their suite of rooms in the King's castle. 
</P>
<P>
Now the waiting began. Hygulf knew that the Council of Summoners would find them, but how and when? Just in case they arrived in person, he sent a page to bring food and drink for "several guests who may be arriving soon." He didn't have long to wait before a huge, beautiful diamond crystal flew in through the window and hovered nearby. It must have been the size of his fist! Wary, Hygulf suppressed magic in the area and was disappointed to watch the gem vanish completely. (It was too big to fit in a pouch, anyway.) As soon as he ended the suppression, the gem reappeared. Zachery reached out to touch it and... poof! he vanished.
</P>
<P>
Frightened and worried, our other heroes stayed as far from the gem as they could, but it started flying at each in turn. First Skeeve, then the assassin, and finally Hygulf were all touched by the gem and vanished.
</P>
<P>
The four reappeared inside a fantastic place. They stood in the center of a huge pentacle, set in ivory on a wide stone floor. There were no walls, but a enormous silvery dome rose from the floor to far above their heads. The dome seemed to let some light through from above, but none from the sides. Strange blurry shapes moved beyond the semi-transparent dome in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
Minutes passed. Suddenly a spark of light appeared nearby, outside the pentacle, followed by a dark hooded robe. Another man (?) appeared and another. Shortly, the pentacle was surrounded by twelve men in nearly identical robes. One of them, the one nearest the light, threw back his hood to reveal his identity; Bigby, one of the greatest of wizards. In turn, each man removed his hood... It was the Council of Summoners.
</P>
<P>
They spoke dire words. "You dared to travel the planes without permission!" "After your previous actions, you should know better." "Do you realize what the punishment is for illegal planar travel?" 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Donnson spoke up, "They informed me of their plans before they left. I would like to sponsor them for admission." That took the wind out of their sails! Bigby in particular snarled in Donnson's direction. "We must discuss this privately," Bigby said, drawing the group away from the pentacle for a protracted discussion.
</P>
<P>
During all this, our heroes were too busy being in shock to do much. As the council members had revealed themselves, Zachery noticed that one of them was Costanza! "Well connected bastard, isn't he?" asked Skeeve of no one in particular. Our heroes immediately contacted one another and held a discussion of their own psionically. "What do we do now?"
</P>
<P>
Zachery thought it might be best to talk with Costanza and ask him about the money he was supposed to send to replace Hygulf's shop. Hygulf wanted none of that -- Costanza still didn't really know who the Illuminati were and he would like to keep it that way. Zachery and Hygulf argued a bit, but suddenly Costanza came over to the edge of the pentacle and beckoned to them.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard good things about you," he said in his nasal voice. "I would like to talk to you about the future of our kind."
</P>
<P>
"What exactly do you mean?" replied Hygulf, waiting for the spark of recognition in Costanza's eyes that would spell our heroes' doom.
</P>
<P>
"I mean: Have you ever wondered why we live in secrecy? Why we don't show ourselves to the world? Because they are afraid of us and would try to destroy us. But: how would you like to live in a place where psionicists were recognized as the powerful members of society that we are. A place where our kind could live without fear of lynchings, without hatred. A place where we could help normals to live better lives with our powers. Well: I'm building such a place. Soon, we may all live free of the chains society has placed upon us to keep us down. Soon, we will have a place... a homeland... for our kind.
</P>
<P>
"But: I need some help in this great endeavour. I have heard that you are all good psionicists and that you have been working towards a place where we can be free. Join with me and we can make that place a reality."
</P>
<P>
"We'll get back to you," answered Hygulf, his hand firmly over Zachery's mouth. Costanza invited our heroes to meet with him any time, at his offices in Nethathon, to talk about his vision for the future, and then moved back to where the other council members still congregated.
</P>
<P>
"Charming, isn't he?" asked the assassin, who had not yet met Costanza. Our heroes discussion was cut short by the return of the Council of Summoners.
</P>
<P>
Bigby spoke, "We have decided to offer you membership in the Council. Your initiation task is to retrieve a book for us: the Tome of Martek. It contains summoning spells that we need for our research. If you do not bring this book to us, we will punish you by stranding you in a prison plane for ten years. If you can produce the Tome, you will be accepted as members of the Council. We believe the book can be found in or around the Great Library... I suggest you start there."
</P>
<P>
With that, our heroes were dropped onto the landing pad outside the Library. A storm raged, but they made it in without incident. Sylea, their usual elven Assistant Librarian, joined them and set up a meeting with Stonne, the Librarian. 
</P>
<P>
Stonne received our heroes in his official office -- a long room with a painting on each side. On the left, a painting of Arvandor, the elven heaven, with trees and elves and music and dancing. On the right, a painting of Baator, bleak, ruddy, desolation. Stonne himself sat behind a beautiful desk, made from the trunk of a gigantic mahogany tree.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes explained their situation. The moment they mentioned the Tome of Martek, Stonne interrupted. "No one can see that book." Hygulf asked why, so Stonne explained. "The book contains a list of name of demons, some very powerful ones, who could be called to this plane by a talented summoner. However, once these powers have a way in, they would never leave until this whole place became a wasteland. Even reading the names or thinking them can give these demons a way in. No one can see the book, and the summoners certainly cannot have it!"
</P>
<P>
Zachery asked why the book hadn't been destroyed, so Stonne explained further that he had tried everything to destroy it: fire, lightning, strength, cold, even using artifacts, throwing it into the fires of Baator, drowning it in the river Styx, and just about everything else, short of having a deity destroy it. "Why not that?" asked Zachery again. "Because a deity might decide that the easiest way to destroy it would be to destroy the whole plane," Stonne answered.
</P>
<P>
Never stymied, our heroes discussed three possible plans:
</P>
<oL>
<LI>Write a similar book. Since the Council has never seen this book, they might not know if they got a book containing demons' names... just not the powerful ones. Stonne asks several assistants to start researching this right away.</LI>
<LI>Time travel back to the past and convince Martek to re-write the book or corrupt it. </LI>
<LI>Time travel to the future and ignore the Council of Summoners. Odds are good that none of the current Council members will be around in 500 years or so. Of course, Costanza might take over the world in the meantime...</LI>
</oL>
<P>
After the long discussion, Skeeve and Zachery headed off to sleep in their quarters in the Library. Hygulf and the assassin "went for a walk." The assassin noticed that they were constantly followed by Sylea, as if they had to always be chaperoned. The assassin suggested that she was going to look into a way to steal the book, just in case none of the other avenues produced a solution.
</P>
<P>
So, will they get the book? Will our heroes forget the world and travel to a unknown future? Or will they visit the desparate, demon-infested past? Stay tuned!
</P>
