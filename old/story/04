26 Planting through 10 Reaping (70+ days)
</P>
<P>
It went by so fast! And yet... there is a lot to be told.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes started meditating almost immediately after finishing their new
level training. Using secrets learned from the Ancient Writings and Master
Brand, Hygulf and Zachery used Meditation to raise their abilities. This
wouldn't have been a problem, except to do it requires a minimum of 50 days in
constant meditation! So, they arranged to pretend to leave town and then snuck
back into Master Brand's secret training cellar, where he could bring food and
help with their study. After 40 days, Zachery realized that he was getting
nowhere and wisely gave up. (three 5s in a row! Are you *sure* that was your
lucky die?) Hygulf had the opposite problem, but after meditating for 70 days
straight, he managed to increase his Constitution by 1 point.
Congratulations!
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Templar Faustus was trying to "clean up and rebuild" the abandoned
Monastery. He made several trips to Alhwick to put together a team of an
engineer, architect, and powerful Curate to bless and sanctify the structure.
Lawgiver Sigmund helped as well. Everything came together after about 60 days,
and it looked like the monks who had arrived would be able to settle in
nicely...
</P>
<P>
Two things happened in town during this time: the New Castle was finished, and
the Baron moved in. A celebration was held, complete with jousts and feasts and
ceremonies... and an assassination attempt on Lawgiver Sigmund! During the
celebration, he was stabbed by an invisible assassin using a poisoned Ketite
dagger. The assassin was not caught, but Sigmund was not permanently harmed,
either. (Imagine using poison on a Cleric! That assassin won't last very
long...)
</P>
<P>
The other thing was a raid on the town by a local goblin tribe. The mage
Rathwyn had predicted such an occurrence, and the town watch was prepared. The
goblins caused only little trouble, and no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since the two psionicists had supposedly left town for the same
place, Zachery was left with about 30 days stuck in the cellar with nothing to
do. He used the time to practice his new powers: ESP and Sight Link. He
contacted Lareth and other parties to discover dastardly news.
</P>
<P>
Lareth was raising an army in Gothos, the capital and largest city in Ket. They
were all Bane worshippers and numbered almost 500. They would infiltrate
Hu&aelig;tburg in disguise as Monks (!) and farmers and then attack the town
and Monastery. He seems to be working for a triad of evil: A big military man,
who was found to be Lord Balzac, the baron of a realm some 30 miles from Telos
in Ket; A woman who seems to be a religious leader in the Baneite community and
who can resist mental probes; and a hooded old man, (resembling the Emperor in
Return of the Jedi) who seems to be the Dark Master that our heroes heard about
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Well, he couldn't just sit on this information, so he went to Rathwyn with a
story about meeting a man on a boat who told him the tale. Then Zachery went
before the Hu&aelig;tburg Council and retold the tale under the watchful eyes
of Lawgiver Sigmund and the Templar. They took the rumor seriously and came up
with a plan to determine if any of the monks were Baneites -- the worst kind of
blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
During a special service at the Monastery, attended only by the monks, Faustus
tested them for evil intent... and found that they were *all* evil! Horrors!
This meant a number of things: 1) that they all must die for such blasphemy, 2)
that the Monastery itself was tainted by their evil hands and must be cleansed
once more, and 3) that it all needed to be covered up so that people would not
lose faith in Tyr's church. 
</P>
<P>
It was arranged that another special service would be held, and an explosive
device would be planted to blow up the Monastery -- hopefully with just enough
time for Sigmund and Faustus to escape. At the last moment, Hygulf and Zachery
decided to go see the Templar. They had wondered about his ability to defend
against psionic attack and thought he might be working for the Baneites and the
Dark Master. They met him at the gate of the Monastery just minutes before the
special service and probed his mind. Zachery discovered that he was not a
Baneite, but was a Psionic Wild Talent. Of course, the method of their
conversation seems to have told the Templar that at least one of them is a mind
witch...
</P>
<P>
We ended on Reaping 10th, right after the Monastery exploded, killing all the
monks but six: one who was found at the last minute to be good, and five who
escaped the flames only to be cut down by the Templar's sword and Lawgiver's
Mace. Our heroes met in the tunnel (back door) to the catacombs as the
outsiders were searching for survivors and the insiders were leaving.
</P>
<P>
So, will the Templar confront the suspected Mindwitches? Will our heroes join
forces to help the Templar use his powers more effectively? Will Lareth show up
with the rest of his army and besiege the town? Will the female assassin be
caught for slaying the man in the Inn? Will Zachery discover that there is a
"Psionic Internet" and publish a home page? We'll find out next week...
</P>

</H2>
<P>
10 - 12 Reaping:
</P>
<P>
After the great explosion in the Monastery, our heroes met in the exit tunnel.
There were many suspicious rumors floating about, but they *may* clear
themselves up. It was decided that the church of Tyr would have no comment on
the tragedy, but popular rumor blames it on the Baneites that were supposedly
"wiped out" before. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between Templar and mindwitches was something to behold!
Arranging for a private dinner, Hygulf, Zachery, and Skeeve figured that they
could convert or kill the Templar easily. Hah! Accusations flew -- Faustus
threatened everyone with death (or at least being turned in to the church...
"I'll get the marshmallows," said Skeeve). When he refused to convert right
there, Hygulf tried to stop him -- and discovered that he can teleport! So, our
heroes rushed to the church and searched out the errant Bruder in a hidden
"holy" room. (side note: Why can't people transport in or out of that room?
What is there to hide or protect?) Dimension Dooring to the docks, found Hygulf
and Faustus locked in a bloody brawl. They were there only a minute or so
before returning to the church, but were seen by a couple of sailors. ("That's
OK. Any drunken sailor is better than Sigmund!" said Zachery) Back inside,
Zachery got into the Templar's mind and made Hygulf look like an Invincible Foe
-- Faustus went down like a rock. 
</P>
<P>
After tying him up and sedating him, Master Brand was called in. He offered to
help talk to the Templar, but could not coerce him. Zachery entered the
comatose Templar's mind and got him to promise to listen to their arguments.
Finally, Faustus realized that these people were not evil and had a good point
-- but he still had to tell Sigmund and the Church.
</P>
<P>
Sigmund was not happy to hear that Faustus was a mind witch. ("That's really
not a good term," said Faustus, echoing Master Brand's earlier words.) In fact,
the Templar was sentenced to death immediately. Faustus tried to talk Sigmund
out of it, but there's no stopping Church Doctrine. However, the next day
Sigmund recanted. He had asked Tyr what would be best and discovered that it
would be *bad* to kill the Templar. So, Faustus is stripped of his rank and
standing, has to turn in his gun and badge and never set foot in a Church of
Tyr again.
</P>
<P>
Will he be able to go on? Will he retain his Tyr-given Paladin status? WHAT
WILL HE DO NOW WITHOUT THE CHURCH ORDERING HIM ABOUT??? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we found that Skeeve had visited Wayland. (400 miles! The advantages
of being a Psychoporter!) He found a ruined Autarch's tomb surrounded by the
Wayland military -- including "registered" psionics! To be finally legally
recognized as a useful profession is the dream of many psionicists -- but it
seems that this was done with the knowledge of the Network. The leading
individuals "resigned" from the Network to attempt to stop the Autarch from
re-appearing. And, they made Psionic detecting amulets for the top military
leaders... tools of control and of slavery, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
Of course, we know what the penalty of not working within the Network is...
</P>
