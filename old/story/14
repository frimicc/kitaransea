Previously:
</P>
<P>
During the past four months, Skeeve spent his time examining other avenues.
Much of his time was spent with his body in Alhwick, and his astral spirit in
Skullport, deep beneath the city. He has managed to create a relatively
detailed map of the area.
</P>
<P>
On one of his earliest excursions, he met up with a Blue Dragon! But, the
creature was trapped in a cave by a higher power. Skeeve managed to convince it
that he could help it escape by using Dream Travel. The dragon didn't believe
this at first, but when it worked, it was overwhelmed!
</P>
<P>
As a reward, Skeeve was given all of the dragon's treasure... :-)
(including a number of magic items!)
</P>
<P>
So, even though Skeeve didn't spend the time doing "Great Deeds", he did manage
to:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
- get rich, and
</LI>
<LI>
- free an Old, Lawful-Evil Blue Dragon from its imprisonment, so that it
could fly free over the earth, killing cattle, kidnapping maidens, etc.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Be there this week for *finally* the coronation in Beogar!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC41">Thirty-Ninth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Sun'sebb 23, 1899 (and thereabouts):
</P>
<P>
Skeeve rejoins the group!
</P>
To make up for his lack of presence earlier (not really :) ), Skeeve also
shared his wealth with his fellow adventurers:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Faustus received a Javelin of Lightning.
</LI>
<LI>
Zachery received a Rod of Cancellation and a Ring of Blinking.
</LI>
<LI>
Hrethgol (Hygulf) received a Ring of Free Action and 10,000 gp.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
(Note: Skeeve borrowed 7500gp from himself in the future to lend $$ to
Hygulf. Time travel is a wonderful thing.:-))
</P>
<P>
Once the trades were settled, our heroes proceeded to the Dwarven Stronghold to
buy a 10,000gp gem. (Hrethgol wants a receptacle) While there, they bought some
gems and sold a Longtooth Dagger and Zachery's Rod (which bought a magnificent
star ruby on a mithril necklace).
</P>
<P>
From there, our heroes used Skeeve's Wormhole power to travel to C&aelig;lwynn,
for the coronation.
</P>
<P>
In the royal city, our heroes scouted for information about the new King:
</P>
<P>
(BTW, the royal family's names are <BR>
Hrethrew (the king), <BR>
Leofbert (age 14), and <BR>
Coenbalthter (age 12).)
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
when contact was attempted, the King defended himself... he is a
psionicist!
</LI>
<LI>
the King's "girlfriend"/advisor looks remarkably like one of the missing
psionicists, who were presumed dead or lost when Costanza's tomb was opened.
</LI>
<LI>
the mayor of Selenica himself will be on hand for the coronation, in a day or
so.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
So, be here next time to find out the truth about Hrethrew!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC42">Fortieth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Needfest 1900:
</P>
<P>
Hygulf discovered a neat trick with his metamorphosis this session: he can make
his skin into a diamond-like substance, giving him an AC of 2. However, since
his body still needs to breath, etc. through skin, he can only keep this form
for about a half-hour before he starts taking internal damage.
</P>
<P>
We started by contacting the King's consort, Lily. Lily has met Costanza, and
doesn't like him. She said that the King didn't either. However, she has been
contacted many times before... Our heroes arranged a meeting with the new King
Hrethrew to tell him of the great danger he faces, for that night.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Hygulf went to check out the Mage's tower, in the castle. No
one had been inside it, since the Mage was kicked out a couple of months ago.
Inside, he found summoner's tools and a goat. When someone knocked on the door,
he escaped quickly.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf also met with our friend the assassin, who is now using the name
"Sarassin", and who told him that there was a secret passage into the King's
bedchamber. There were some people who *definitely* wanted the old and new
Kings dead, so our heroes should watch out...
</P>
<P>
Later our heroes met with the King-to-be. Hrethrew was very honest and open
with them... it turns out that he is a Psionicist! (And a member of the
Network)
</P>
<P>
He recruited our heroes to help found a new knightly order, the Knights of the
Mind. They will firstly, protect the world against Costanza, and secondly,
promote well-being between psionicists and normals. He had been sent to
Selenica to spy on Costanza, and got some information but not lots.
</P>
<P>
Hrethrew also wanted to know how his father, the old King, was killed. So,
Skeeve time travelled back to watch the murder. He waited in the secret passage
until he saw an assassin there -- the assassin crept into the bedroom and
poured poison into the King's ear. So, it was only with "normal" means that the
King was killed. (Maybe Costanza wasn't behind it?)
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC43">Forty-First Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Also Needfest, 1900:
</P>
<P>
While waiting for the coronation ceremonies to occur the next day, Hygulf
decided to check in at the Great Elven Library and pick up the digests of
Costanza's activities. However, he discovered that the auto-book writing down
Costanza's life had been stolen! Sometime during the night of Sun'sebb 18,
1899. (2 weeks earlier) Hygulf got what they had, and returned to C&aelig;lwynn
for the coronation.
</P>
<P>
Many things happened during the coronation and the party afterwards:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
News, the vizier of Ket was fired and the new vizier, Erden, seems to be a
"Dark Master"-like figure.
</LI>
<LI>
Costanza himself came to the coronation, and went up to the new King and
wished him well... (?)
</LI>
<LI>
The Dwarves from the Telos Mtns. brought a magic anvil that will make things
that won't break. This gift really excited the King.
</LI>
<LI>
Our friend, the assassin was there, dressed as a fop, the younger son of a
small noble. Her/his name was Frihilde. Although, no one knows who she was
after...
</LI>
<LI>
A woman who looked very much like the King's consort sat with Costanza at the
party. She was astrally projecting in the room, and had a nice chat with
Skeeve. They both stayed away from the Githyanki who was standing astrally by
the door and who said he was there to protect the King.
</LI>
<LI>
Skeeve stole a set of papers from Costanza, containing lists of names and
places. Some of the names were people who used to work for the King.(!)
</LI>
<LI>
A possible vampire, who called himself "Zagig", was at the party. No one knew
who he was with...
</LI>
<LI>
Hygulf got to know the Dwarves from the Telos Mtns. pretty well. He was
invited to visit their city when he is in the area.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
After the party broke up, the King went back to his chambers. For safety,
Hygulf metamorphosized into the King and slept in his bed. The King hid in the
closet. As expected, a man leaped in to attack the King that night. The
assassin pricked Hygulf with a poison that put him to sleep, but the other
guards arrived in time to save him. Once the man was captured, Zachery used
Psychic Surgery on him to remove the permenent Domination that Costanza had
placed on him. The man was ashamed of his behavior and told his captors
*everything* he knew about Costanza and his network of spies and informants.
</P>
<P>
The only problem is that Costanza would surely have the man killed immediately,
once he found out that his conditioning had broken. To save him and the King,
Hygulf and Skeeve teleported the four of them to the Elven Library. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Librarian was not happy to see them. It seems that the
Library didn't allow political rulers within its walls. But, since it was
snowing outside, our heroes were allowed to spend the rest of the night in the
lobby of the Library.
</P>
<P>
What happens next? Will the ex-dominatee know anything important? Will there be
more attacks on the King? What will the Knights of the Mind do, anyway? Be here
next time!
</P>
