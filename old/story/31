<P>
Wealsun 24, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes talk with Stonne, the Librarian, again.
</P>
<P>
He explains that it seems that they can produce a &quot;fake&quot; Tome of Martek. It will have the names of some minor demons in it, instead of the great Princes of Evil the actual book contains. The Council of Summoners will discover the ruse at some point, but it may buy our heroes a year or so.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf asked a pointed question, &quot;What happens if you kill a summoner?&quot;
</P>
<P>
Stonne was not quite sure, but he expected that it would not be a good thing... Then Hygulf and Skeeve brought the Librarian up-to-date on their plans to kill Costanza. Stonne offered to lend them an Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location, but for their plan to succeed, they would need two such amulets. Maybe another wizard in the Library would lend them one?
</P>
<P>
Some research showed that at least one such amulet was in a great dragon's hoard. Drogburggrot, an ancient <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> who lives in the Oidillaf, was rumored to have an amulet, but obtaining it would be dangerous. Much better to try asking around, first.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes asked Sylea, their assistant librarian, to ask the other assistants on the sly if any of the wizards visiting had an amulet. In fact, two did: Telcolwasred, an Illusionist from Ket, and Thiellion, a wood elf from the La'Nar'Ran. Since Skeeve in particular has a bad reputation with Ketites, he and Hygulf approached the elf.
</P>
<P>
Over lunch, Thiellion was quite friendly and helpful. He seemed particularly enamored of the assassin, who was now posing as Elethilnw&aelig;n, and elven rogue. Thiellion explained that he also desired revenge against Costanza, since 2,000 years ago Costanza burned large parts of the La'Nar'Ran in an attempt to drive out the elves. He succeeded in killing many, at least, including Thiellion's family. As such, Thiellion was willing to lend our heroes his amulet for a paltry sum: two months of their help doing some research of his. He has been working on using dragons' hoards as a way of examining history -- all he needs are volunteers to help him inventory a couple of really big ones... without killing the dragon, of course!
</P>
<P>
With that in their future, our heroes decided that maybe the Prison World that Bigby is going to send them to won't be so bad...
</P>
<P>
So, Hygulf and Skeeve were finally ready to battle Costanza! Skeeve contacted their target and offered to meet him with the Tome of Martek at a neutral location in northern Wayland. Two hours later, the plan was in action.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf and Skeeve arrived at the designated spot on time and waited an interminable minute for Costanza. As they walked towards their sworn enemy, they used their psionics to keep him from teleporting away. As they came closer to the unsuspecting Costanza and his two hulking bodyguards, Hygulf noticed that the guards were &quot;speeded up&quot;, moving six times faster than normal. He, of course, followed suit immediately. Finally, as they met on the field, Skeeve put up his Stasis Field and Hygulf used Subjective Reality to make it not affect him.
</P>
<P>
Everything was frozen in time. Costanza, his two bodyguards, and Skeeve were all moving at 1/60th their normal speed, while Hygulf continued to move at six times normal. He used this time to his advantage, immediately stripping Costanza's clothes off, cutting them as needed. All the rings and gems Costanza wore went into a large bag. Finally, Hygulf pulls out his two Dimension-bladed swords and attempted to cut off Costanza's head! It took five tries, but finally Hygulf got through and Costanza's head fell in slow motion. His bodyguards could do nothing to stop it...
</P>
<P>
Things started moving again as Hygulf attempted to teleport himself, the body, and Skeeve away from the destruction and found that he couldn't! Something from Costanza's body was causing Psionic Inflation, making it more difficult than normal to use their powers. All Hygulf could do was wormhole them 100 miles away, which would not be much of a lead!
</P>
<P>
At that point, Skeeve realized that it must be something from Costanza, so he stood fifty yards away from Hygulf and opened a wormhole back to the Library easily. 
</P>
<P>
At the Library, our heroes banged on the door until they were allowed into the entrance. Stonne and Thiellion met them there and received the loaned amulets back. Stonne suggested that Hygulf and Skeeve go find someplace to put the body, but they only shrugged their shoulders. So, in a fit of anger, Stonne disintegrated Costanza's body and head, ensuring that no one could resurrect the old Autarch...
</P>
<P>
And we ended the session with a moment of silence for Costanza's passing. Who knows if he will be raised from the dead or wished back to life? Maybe he had a clone waiting? For now, at least, he is gone and no longer a threat.
</P>
<P>
Be here next time when the fallout starts!
</P>
