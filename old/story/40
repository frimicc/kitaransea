Reaping 14 - 15, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes decided to take on the current inhabitants of Castle Earnsige.
</P>
<P>
First, Skeeve contacted the old woman being held prisoner in the dungeon of the castle. She told him that even though she's been imprisoned for several months, she doesn't hate her captors. They saved the town from the orcs and have spent their own time and money building roads and houses and they bring in quite a few &quot;luxury&quot; goods that the townsfolk would not otherwise be able to afford. She said she isn't alone in this belief -- most of the townsfolk like their current lords.
</P>
<P>
Disheartened, but still defiant, Skeeve searched the castle astrally, looking for the psionicists in residence. He could not <i>see</i> any of them, but he did see two &quot;bubbles&quot;, such as would be present if a Tower of Iron Will were being used. Where could the third be? Skeeve also noticed that the pirate ship was not anchored in the harbor and there were only 70 men or so in the castle, a little more than half as many as were there the last time he explored it. 
</P>
<P>
So, Hygulf and Skeeve decide to attack the ship while it is away from the safety of the castle. First, though, what to do if they win? Skeeve contacted King Hrethrew to ask him if C&aelig;lwynn had anyplace to keep captured psionicists. "I'm sorry," the King replied, "but the Church of Tyr won't let us keep psionic prisoners. Besides, how could we keep them immobilized? Any psionicists brought here will get the standard punishment... Death by Beheading." Hygulf decided they'd burn that bridge when they came to it, so off to the ship!
</P>
<P>
That night, Skeeve contacted the Pirate Captain and located him as just off the coast, at the mouth of the Gorgon River in Athmyr. Skeeve, Hygulf, and the Assassin teleported to the coast, to see if they could get on a ship that would be attacked by the pirates, to give them an excuse to attack the psionicists. (and some cover!) The next morning, a coaster came down the river and stopped in the port town to refresh its provisions. The ship was leaving before nightfall to cross the sea to C&aelig;lwynn. Our heroes bought passage on the cargo ship, without telling the captain or crew that they were about to be attacked by pirates.
</P>
<P>
In preparation, though, Hygulf tried to give the Assassin his Ring of Tower of Iron Will, to protect her from psionics. Skeeve won her over, though, by offering her his Ring of Invisibility... (The question now becomes, will he ever get it back?)
</P>
<P>
A few hours after leaving port, the ship sighted the pirates and rolled out a great ballista to set up in the prow. The battle was engaged! The pirates threw a fireball at the ship, but it did only minor damage. Then the pirates started hurling flaming pitch, from a small catapult on their deck. In the meantime, the ship's mage fired back -- his fireball hit the pirates straight on and took out many of their men. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Skeeve examined the pirate ship and found no psionicists! Where was the third one? But he did see that the pirates only had one mage. But how to exploit that weakness? The Assassin volunteered to take care of him. Hygulf teleported her (invisible) to the pirate ship's deck. Moments later, the mage buckled over, with the Assassin appearing behind him, her very sharp stiletto protruding from his ribs. Hygulf instantly teleported her back, and they proceeded to sit out the rest of the battle. 
</P>
<P>
It was over soon. Without their mage, the pirates had no strategic weapon, and surrendered after a short boarding action by the coaster's well-trained crew. 
</P>
<P>
The pirate captain was brought aboard and Hygulf requested to talk with him. He refused to talk, until Skeeve probed him... It seems that the third psionicist had a falling-out with the others and ran off. Our heroes mindwiped him, so he would not remember their part in the battle and then teleported back to shore. The coaster also headed back to port, with the remains of the pirate ship in tow.
</P>
<P>
So, what will happen next? Will our heroes finally attack the Castle? Will the psionicists vacate? Will the pirate captain vow revenge? Be here next time!
</P>
