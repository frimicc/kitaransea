Our heroes debated a bit more about trying to kill Costanza and Zachery came up with an amazing idea: try <I>talking</I> to Costanza instead. This was swiftly vetoed. Finally, it was time for Zachery to introduce his father to his wife (!).
</P>
<P>
Hygulf picked up the assassin from Telandyr and wormholed her to the hotel in H&aelig;dburg where our heroes were staying. The assassin was made up for the occasion: she looked beautiful, young, and blond. As &quot;Fatima&quot;, she and Zachery came up with their cover story. The two of them had only been married for about three months, to avoid any questions about children. Fatima was from the Vorloi family, known in Gothos as honorable assassins... During a bit of discussion, it came out that our heroes were working on Red Dragon scale armor -- Fatima was delighted to hear that and pressed for more details. Hygulf made up a story about Dhak &quot;shedding&quot; to keep her from knowing that our heroes have a nearly unlimited supply of dragon scales...
</P>
<P>
Once everything is set, everyone used a wormhole to travel to Zachery's father's estate, outside Gothos. Upon arrival, Zachery's father, Lucius, greeted the party warmly. They were given a guided tour of the estate by the head of the household, Jeffrey, a 25-year-old slave who had been with the house for almost ten years. By the end of the tour, Skeeve realized that Jeffrey knew who he was (Skeeve was going under the name John Bookbinder, to avoid any problems with him being identified as the &quot;Hero of the Battle of Gothos&quot;). Skeeve asked him to keep quiet about his true identity and they would talk later.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes had a wonderful dinner with the family, but Zachery's behavior seemed strange to Hygulf and Skeeve. After dinner in their private sitting room, Zachery even attempted to defend the long-standing Ket practice of slavery. A heated debate ensued, with even the assassin chiming in that slavery was never a good thing. To prove his point, Zachery read the mind of a nearby slave, who thought that the first thing he would do if freed would be to kill his masters. Zachery saw this as anti-social behavior; the others saw it as revenge for the horrible things done to the slaves by Zachery's father.
</P>
<P>
That night, Jeffrey and Skeeve talked. Skeeve offered to buy Jeffrey's freedom, but Jeffrey insisted that he should save another family: one with three young girls who had been ravaged by Lucius several times. This, and the tour of the &quot;new chapel to Bane&quot; in the house that Lucius built (his new hobby is learning to be a priest of Bane) were more than enough proof for Hygulf and Skeeve that Zachery's father is truly evil. Zachery was not convinced, though.
</P>
<P>
The next day, our heroes wandered around through the house. They spent some time in the Library, where Skeeve memorized a book on ancient Ruander, including a map of the old city. In the center of the city, where now there is a giant crater, was a huge statue of Costanza... Our heroes also met Goth, Lucius's personal teacher and the household's priest of Bane. Zachery's mother seemed nice enough, though. A little later, our heroes discovered the secret spy holes and passageways through the house, which Lucius was using to spy on them. They didn't say anything to the family, though.
</P>
<P>
That night's dinner was a feast for several of Lucius's friends. He introduced Zachery and his lovely wife to one and all. After dinner, entertainment was acrobats and a non-magical magician (card tricks, etc.). All the entertainers were slaves of the house, of course. 
</P>
<P>
That night, the assassin offered a way to get Lucius to sell the slaves to our heroes: she would ask for them as a wedding gift, to help them start their own household. Since Jeffrey was so valuable to Zachery's family, it seemed like the only way to get him and the others out without a fight. Fatima talked with Lucius and it was all taken care of. In the morning, our heroes left the house with the slaves and traveled back to Hu&aelig;tburg with them. Once there, they were free! 
</P>
<P>
To give them a job, Jeffrey and the others were put in charge of setting up Dhak's stables, with a decent wage and place to live in the town. When our heroes finally get a castle of their own, Jeffrey will run the house for them.

The return of Faustus!
</P>
<P>
Hygulf and Skeeve were most appalled at Zachery's recent behavior, so they decided to contact Faustus and have him come talk to the evil-leaning psionicist. Faustus, while not excited to be interrupted in his studies of the great lands to the south, agreed to teleport to Hu&aelig;tburg to talk with Zachery. While he didn't speak of what he knew about the South, he appeared wearing monkish robes and wearing a turban. Geronmen, his faithful follower, was shocked, but convinced Faustus to at least wear his armor while in Beogar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zachery contacted the King to see if he could arrange some land to trade for the Castle Earnsige, which our heroes want to buy. The King said that he would look into the request, but it could take him a week or more to procure the appropriate property. Then Zachery went flying on Dhak, so that he was out-of-town when Faustus arrived.
</P>
<P>
Faustus was a sight as he rode through the town on Bucephalus, his pegacorn! With him was his entourage: Geronmen on his horse and a couple of squires leading the animals through the streets. As such a sight, he drew crowds. Everyone remembered how he helped save the town in the past, so commoners thronged around him. Faustus initially went to visit Sigmund, who brought him up-to-date on local happenings, such as the coming of the (tame) dragon. After the church, Faustus rode to Hygulf's shop in the not-so-nice section of town. To get rid of the beggars crowding around him, Faustus used his psionics to blink a bag of gold down the street -- an act which proves more than anything else that his exposure to acceptable psionics in the South has changed him.
</P>
<P>
Zachery returned to the shop and was floored by Faustus's sudden appearance. He immediately took Faustus off for a walk, to show him the stables and Dhak. Faustus started questioning Zachery about evil influences in his life, but Zachery wouldn't hear him. Zachery wondered why Faustus never wrote and if he received all the letters Zachery had written him -- Faustus responded with confusion and admitted he hadn't heard about any letters. It's a good thing Zachery kept copies of them all...
</P>
<P>
That night, the Baron threw a great feast for Faustus's return. Everyone who was anyone in town was there and our heroes all had seats at the Baron's table. The evening passed quickly, because our heroes were heavily involved in their own conversation: when Faustus detected evil on Zachery, he realized that Zachery was tainted with evil! Zachery denied all the charges, but when Inforanel used true sight to view Zachery's true nature, he too mentioned that Zachery was drifting towards evil. Zachery was distraught and ran out of the room. (Partly because our heroes were discussing Zachery killing his own father as a way of purging himself of the evil within him!) 
</P>
<P>
Finally, everyone went to sleep. In the middle of the night, Zachery bribed a squire to let him into Faustus's room, where Faustus was meditating and praying. Faustus refused to see Zachery and had him bodily removed from the room. Faustus would no longer associate with him, due to the evil he detected.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, at an informal breakfast with the Baron, Zachery told the others about a disturbing dream he had: He saw Faustus on his knees, praying to Zachery's father at the alter of Bane in Lucius's house! Rathwyn, with reluctance, attempted to interpret Zachery's dream, but didn't understand it. Everyone agreed, though, that Zachery should immediately go see his father and talk to him. Hygulf opened a wormhole for him...
</P>
<P>
Outside Gothos, Skeeve contacted Zachery to find out what would happen -- and the truth came out that Hygulf and Skeeve had requested Faustus come back. Zachery was greatly upset. He became quite angry and immediately returned to Hu&aelig;tburg to discover the truth. For some reason, Zachery felt less of Faustus that he came back due to the others' urging. Another argument ensued...
</P>
<P>
In the end, our heroes realized that they could argue forever. Conversation turned towards what to do next. They agreed that Faustus should take them back to the South to recruit allies against Costanza...
</P>
<P>
Be here next time for the trip to the South! Sunblock 38, anyone?
