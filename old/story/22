<A NAME="Story58">Fifty-eighth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Flocktime 5-19, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Once again, our heroes begin the session in separate corners: Hygulf and Skeeve are still in C&aelig;lwynn and Zachery is at his father's place, just outside Gothos.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf went to see the King again, about his meeting with the Network. Specifically, Hygulf asked for more information about the Mayor of Selenica, who should have denounced Costanza in front of the Wayland General Assembly by now... Instead, the king agreed that the news about the Mayor of Selenica was &quot;disturbing&quot;. The king himself will try to contact the Network again, but he recommended that Hygulf try his own connections.
</P>
<P>
In other business, Hygulf was still keen on founding a hospital/university/home for wayward psionicists somewhere in Beogar. The king mentioned that a number of castles had been built along the coast to the east, in the Cruth Mountains, but none of them had been profitable or lasted very long. To Hygulf, that sounded like the perfect place to house the new order. He got a letter from the king authorizing him to research the various castles and abandoned baronies in that area. Then he set out to astrally scount around. After several days of scouting, he found a small group of castles that might fit their needs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zachery continued his ruse to Metellus, his father. Metellus seemed leery of believing that Zachery had settled down, and wanted to meet his new daughter-in-law. So, Zachery contacted the assassin to attempt to convince her to play his &quot;wife&quot;. The assassin, amazingly, seemed OK with the idea, but would charge 10,000gp a day and there would be no sexual relations... Zachery assured her that she wasn't his type. ;) They set the time for two weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
Zachery, having pacified his father for now, contacted Hygulf and made plans to leave Gothos. He got Dhak (short form of Dhakgababdorblad) to fly a ways out, and then Hygulf wormholed them back to the crater/cave, high in the Granos Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Back together again, they decided to use their powers to scout the castles on the coast more thouroughly. Zachery used Clairvoyance to look around a few, until they found the best one. The best one, though, was occupied by a group of bandits and their leaders -- who are psionic! The Castle Earnsige used to belong to a man named Hildebec, before it was stormed by bandits and plagued by orcs. Hildebec's remaining family live in H&aelig;dburg, where our heroes will need to go to get permission to take over the castle. Then the fun part begins...
</P>
<P>
During the two weeks spent scouting for a place to live, our heroes also put into action their plan for &quot;harvesting&quot; dragon scales from Dhak. Zachery used False Sensory Input as an anesthetic while Hygulf used his Dimension Blade to slice the skin off of Dhak's back. After each bit of &quot;harvesting&quot;, Hygulf would Regenerate the damage he had inflicted. It is a slow process, but seemed to work OK. After two weeks of this, our heroes had enough scales to have the dwarves build two suits of dragon-scale armor.
</P>
<P>
Once this was all complete, our heroes left Dhak to fend for himself in the crater and delivered the scales to the dwarves. At the dwarven stronghold, a fantastic feast and party had started! Finally, enough orcs had been killed to measure up to the pole placed in the grand hall. Now, two weeks of celebrating were in order. Our heroes were invited to sit at places of honor, at the Duke's table, and partake of the feast. While the meat seemed tough, Hygulf ate it readily. Zachery had problems, though, when he realized that the huge pile of dead orcs had to have gone somewhere...
</P>
<P>
Finally, everthing was almost ready for Zachery and the assassin's trip to see Zachery's family. Zachery picked Fatima as the name for his wife. Be here next time when we see just how gullible Metellus really is!
</P>

<A NAME="Story59">Fifty-ninth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Flocktime 19, 1900:
</P>
<P>
We spent quite a bit of this session performing a &quot;plot thread roundup&quot;. With something on the order of twenty different plot threads currently active, I needed to get a handle on things. Once that was out of the way, our heroes got back to business.
</P>
<P>
Zachery started the day by contacting Master Brand and asking him about the Mayor of Selenica. &quot;How did he get sent back to Selenica?&quot; Master Brand checked with his sources and reported back that the Network was very cagey about the whole issue. Everyone wanted to know why and for whom he needed the information... very strange.
</P>
<P>
Next, Zachery contacted Bernden, the leader of the Knights of the Mind, to see if he would help our heroes perform a Retrospection, to find out what happened with the Mayor. He agreed to meet our heroes in a few hours. While they waited, our heroes traveled to H&aelig;dburg, to see about getting the rights to Hygulf's favorite castle on the Cruth Coast. Hygulf and Skeeve were temporarily confused about the place bribery holds in H&aelig;dburg society, but the gate guards tried to explain it to them. In the end, Zachery simply Awed them to pass by.
</P>
<P>
In H&aelig;dburg, our heroes talked with the current Master of the Hildebec family, the owners of the castle. It was interesting to see how the rich live in Beogar and productive, too. Hildebec agreed in principle to trade some useful land for the useless castle, if the King would agree to the trade. Our heroes said they would go ask the King and get back to Hildebec. After the meeting, our heroes retired to the Green Dragon Inn, a <I>beautiful</I> place in H&aelig;dburg, where rooms cost in the gold pieces! Zachery could really get to like this kind of living...
</P>
<P>
Shortly, Bernden was brought in to perform the Retrospection. It worked exceedingly well -- Zachery, Skeeve, and Bernden ended up using it several times to gather the following extremely useful information:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
The Mayor of Selenica was freed, by orders of the top people in the Network.
</LI>
<LI>
Those top people consist of seven people who meet in a room at a round table. They refer to each other only by letters of the alphabet - A through G. 
</LI>
<LI>
One of the people in the Network's ruling council is Costanza!!!!
</LI>
<LI>
Two of the people in the Network's ruling council were only seen wearing hoods, so one of them <I>could</I> have been the Dark Master.
</LI>
<LI>
During the vote to determine the fate of the Mayor of Selenica, the Network's ruling council voted 4 to 3 against having him speak to the Assembly. The main reason was that they didn't want a major backlash against <B>all</B> psionicists by paranoid Waylanders. 
</LI>
<LI>
Unsurprisingly, Costanza (known as &quot;C&quot;) voted against having the Mayor speak.
</LI>
<LI>
The Mayor of Selenica is back at his post and psionically Dominated again.
</LI>
<LI>
Our heroes got an image of the Network's &quot;Org Chart&quot;, with contact signatures for almost every member of the organization. Now they know it all... *evil laugh*
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
This frightening information was followed by Bernden's account of Costanza in the Wayland Assembly: Costanza always surrounds himself with 20 people, at least half of whom are psionicists. He is in the process of Dominating Assembly members, and has completed the process on at least 15 so far... Since the Assembly only has 45 members, Costanza already controls over a third!
</P>
<P>
Be here next time when we finally get around to the Assassin playing Zachery's wife! And what will our heroes do about Costanza???!!!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="Story60">Sixtieth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Still Flocktime 19, 1900:
</P>
<P>
&lt;real world&gt; Everyone had a good break. It's been about 6 weeks since the last meeting, so most of this one was catching up. &lt;/real world&gt;
</P>
<P>
Our heroes are still in the Inn in H&aelig;dburg. After the Retrospection, our heroes and Bernden decided that they were going to go after Costanza <I>immediately</I>. Hygulf had a plan... To begin, our heroes attempted to find out where Costanza was right then. Zachery used his clairvoyance to view the Mayoral House in Selenica, where he found a few guards and a psionicist -- all pretty paranoid. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Zachery looked into the mind of an Assemblyman Skeeve knew, in Nethathon. The Assembly was in session, despite the late hour. Carl, the recipient of Zachery's mindlink thought loudly how much he hated Costanza, because he was dominated! Zachery convinced Carl to help him, and our heroes discovered that Costanza always has several psionicists with him, and his armed &quot;brute squad&quot; nearby. Costanza lives in a house on Watergate Row (near the gate to the docks). When Zachery attempted to look inside the house, from the picture Carl had, he was immediately sensed and &quot;jammed&quot; by another psionicist.
</P>
<P>
Be here in two weeks, when we see if our heroes go up against Costanza, or we <I>finally</I> get to watch the assassin play wife!
</P>
