Reaping 12 - 13, 1900:
</P>
<P>
In the morning, our heroes took the dwarven troops home. They had lost about 20% of their numbers, but were still very happy about the battle's outcome. As they made their way through the wormhole, every dwarf thanked Hygulf and Skeeve for a chance to die with honor fighting their hated foes. Hygulf, Skeeve, and the assassin followed them through, to tell the story to Duke Gonbard.
</P>
<P>
Zachery saddled up Dhak and started the flight back to C&aelig;lwynn, where the dragon could be stabled. Zachery was contacted by King Hrethrew while in flight and told that his father had sent a message for him. Zachery contacted his father and was told that the Emperor had summoned Zachery to Gothos for "military matters". Zachery contacted Skeeve and let him know that he would not be joining them, and turned Dhak northward, towards Gothos.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Skeeve, Hygulf, and the assassin briefed the duke on the Siege of Coensige. The duke was excited by the ease with which his troops had dispatched the orcs, due to Skeeve and Hygulf's help. The duke offered them a permanent place with the dwarven army, but our heroes turned him down. They had other matters to attend to. The duke told them that his scouts had seen a number of Ketites in dwarven territory, in places where they must have used magic to reach. One scout said he saw several men in Ket colors standing on top of a mountain which would have taken weeks to climb, yet they were not even wearing proper cold-weather gear.
</P>
<P>
Bad news came from other fronts as well. After meeting with the duke, Skeeve was contacted by Master Brand, who said that someone was looking for the Illuminati. Master Brand was attacked in his own shop by a gang of thugs, led by a couple of psionicists. He managed to escape, but is now in hiding, somewhere other than Hu&aelig;tburg. Skeeve thanked him for the information and wished him luck. "Since your cover is blown, maybe you want a new job?" Skeeve asked. "We're looking for a headmaster for our new Psionic Training Academy." Master Brand said he would think about it. Moments later, he contacted Hygulf, and delivered the same message.
</P>
<P>
What to do first? Our heroes teleported out to their crater camp and looked over the rim for Ketites. Hygulf teleported to several distant mountaintops, keeping his keen eyes peeled for troop movements, but found nothing. Skeeve decided to check the enemy's camp and travelled astrally to Alpanas. There, he saw obvious preparations for a massive troop movement. Strangely, though, there was no wagon train of supplies being prepared. No heavy equipment of any kind, actually -- just men. Returning to Hygulf for a conference, he suggested that they should tell Baron Blackhawk immediately.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes then teleported to the Old Castle in Hu&aelig;tburg, where Rathwyn the mage now lives. Rathwyn agreed to see them and told them about current events in the town. It seems that the men asking about the Illuminati had been to see both him and the baron, in addition to wandering the town. It seemed that these pursuers were telling people that our heroes were mindwitches! People were getting stirred up and many were becoming angry. It would be better for all concerned if Hygulf and Skeeve didn't show their faces in town for a while...
</P>
<P>
But, there was a little matter of the Ketite army. Skeeve told Rathwyn all they knew and Rathwyn agreed that the Ketites must have plans for magical or psionic transportation. They had to inform the baron. Rathwyn headed over to the New Castle to set up the meeting (and clear the hall), and our heroes wormholed over shortly thereafter. The baron listened closely to our heroes and said he would take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
Baron Blackhawk also told them the details of "Cobbler" Brand's incident. None of the thugs lived to tell about the attack, and at least one of them died when "his head exploded", according to witnesses. That, plus the misleading tales that the Illuminati's pursuers were spreading, had caused some unrest in the townsfolk. In fact, a crowd had gathered at the gate of the castle soon after Rathwyn had arrived. They were outside waiting for "those damned mindwitches" to come out...
</P>
<P>
The assassin volunteered to go into town and find out what she could about their pursuers. Hygulf and Skeeve, meanwhile, walked out of the castle to try to defuse the crowd's temper.
</P>
<P>
The crowd was smaller than they had been told, mostly consisting of 20 people standing in such a way as to maximize their apparent size. However, Inforanel's danger sense went off as our heroes approached. Displaying the better part of valor, (It's a good thing Faustus wasn't there!) Hygulf and Skeeve ran off to one side and hid behind a barn. About half of the crowd followed them, including 3 strange-looking children. They were the right height for children, but seemed much too massive. Not like dwarves, but bigger. Worse, all three attempted to contact Skeeve -- they were psionic! 
</P>
<P>
Completely scared, Hygulf and Skeeve wormholed to the Great Elven Library. It was very far away from the strange kids... When it was plain that they hadn't been followed, Skeeve contacted the assassin and teleported her to join them. Then they all entered the safe haven of the Library, sure that their pursuers could not follow.
</P>
<P>
Sylea, their assigned assistant, met them in the foyer and took them to see their own autobook. Hygulf was sure that it would be able to tell them what their pursuers wanted, but as usual, it was not much help. The assassin volunteered that she had discovered that they wanted to capture the Illuminati, if possible, or kill them if not. She did not know why, though.
</P>
<P>
Back in their quarters, in the guest wing of the Library, Skeeve floated an opinion: maybe the Dark Master was trying to find them. The conversation had flowed to Hygulf's claim that Erdun, the Grand Vizier of Ket, was the Dark Master, when the assassin mentioned that he couldn't be. "I've known Erdun for a long time," she admitted, "but he wasn't psionic that I knew." She would tell our heroes little else of value, though.
</P>
<P>
Finally, since they didn't want to bring more trouble to the Library, all three wormholed back to Castle Coensige. Since no one knew it was there, our heroes felt a little safer.
</P>
<P>
What will happen next? War between Ket and Beogar again? The assault on Castle Earnsige, finally? Be here next time!
</P>
