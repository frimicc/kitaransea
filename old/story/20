<A NAME="Story54">Fifty-fourth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Planting 11-14, 1900:
</P>
<P>
So, our heroes finally are about ready to go after the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>.
</P>
<P>
While talking with Leofson, our heroes are introduced to Grimly, a mage of some repute and known around the castle as a dragon slayer! A lunch meeting convinces our heroes that the mage could be helpful in their quest for the great treasure of the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>, so they let him join them. 
</P>
<P>
The plan begins to be put into action! First, a trip to the castle's cellars to find a relatively weak mouse. Some scullery maids quickly pointed Zachery in the right direction. Then he contacted a mouse and attracted it into a sack. Back in his quarters, Zachery used Psychic Surgery to permenantly Dominate the poor mouse. Stage one, completed.
</P>
<P>
Stage two: Zachery used Skeeve's previous visit to the area as a basis for Clairvoyant reconnaisance. After most of a day spent &quot;scouting&quot;, Zachery found the perfect spot to use as a base. A small room, about 200 yards from the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> with a door and only one exit. Unfortunately, a tribe of goblins was also discovered living in the area, but not in that particular room.
</P>
<P>
Stage three: Our heroes asked around to find a place to put the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> after they have captured it. Their best bet looked like the caverns under the castle in C&aelig;lwynn, as described by the Royal Thief Sigegrim, a rat-faced man who was willing to &quot;rent&quot; the space for 3,000gp/month, as long as the cavern wouldn't be used to hold anything dangerous...
</P>
<P>
Stage four: sponge. Our heroes went to the King's mistress to see if she would lend them some more gems to use as receptacles for Psionic Strength. She quickly acquiesces and lends Hygulf and Zachery each a 3,000gp gem for the time being. After this, Hygulf convinced Grimly to cast Stoneskin on him, &quot;just in case it comes down to hand-to-hand&quot;. Next, our heroes rest up and meditate for 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Finally, stage five: transfer. Zachery used Switch Personality with the mouse, moving his mind into its tiny body! Of course, the shock proved too much for the critter, causing Zachery to go into a coma for 40 hours! During those two days, Zachery's body (containing the mind of a mouse) was fine, but ate a lot of cheese.
</P>
<P>
Once Zachery (mouse body) woke up, our heroes wormholed to the scouted room. Grimly Wizard Locked the door and waited. Things went really quickly for Zachery from here: He contacted the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>, used Amnesia on it, and then made it Attracted to small mice (Zachery's mouse-body, in particular). Finally, Hygulf Teleported the mouse right next to the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>!
</P>
<P>
As expected, the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> picked up the mouse instantly and Zachery started to Switch Personalities with the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>! Since the process took ten minutes to complete, the little mouse spent the time trying to distract the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> and keep it from eating him. After the singing and dancing, the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> started to get suspicious -- Zachery was forced to make it have Amnesia again. 
</P>
<P>
Stage ten: the switch completes! Zachery's mind inhabited the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s body and the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s mind was now in the mouse's body. The mouse body, unable to stand the shock, sent the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s mind into a coma... Zachery used the powerful claws to squish it. The <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s mind was gone, leaving Zachery in command of the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s body. *evil laughter*
</P>
<P>
Zachery contacted Hygulf and let him know that the battle was over. Our heroes teleported to the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s chamber to rest, meditate, and recouperate before beginning to extract the treasure.
</P>

<A NAME="Story55">Fifty-fifth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Planting 14-23, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Zachery spent the night of Planting 14th having &quot;Dragon Dreams&quot;. Sitting in the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s body, on top of the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s hoard of treasure, Zachery began to feel like the treasure was worth keeping together, since it would be a shame if anything was lost. Oh, and how gleaming his scales were... As the others awoke, they tried to convince Zachery to go along with the previous plan, but it looked like it was too late! Zachery was becoming the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>! 
</P>
<P>
Hygulf had a brainstorm and Suppressed Magic around the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s body. Instantly it transformed into the shape of a middle-aged human! Zachery realized what was happening, but felt powerless to stop it. Hygulf and Skeeve decided drastic measures were called for: Hygulf used Nerve Manipulation to knock Zachery unconscious for hours. Skeeve then Switched Personalities with Zachery, becoming the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> himself. However, since he knew what was going to happen, he managed to fight the feelings of greed and teleport himself (the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s body) and the treasure (not more than three times his body mass...) to Hygulf's cave/inactive crater high in the Granos Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Once in the relative safety of the crater's bowl, our heroes relaxed. Skeeve started feeling the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s greed and began to count and organize the treasure. The others wormholed back to C&aelig;wynn to pick up the mouse (in Zachery's body). When they arrived, Zachery contacted the mouse and discovered that it was having lunch with the King! Zachery ordered it to come back to their rooms, but the King followed close behind. He was confused, upset, and quite amazed at the story Hygulf told about their adventures. The King suggested that he had some vaults in the castle that our heroes could use to store the treasure... at a mere 15% cost. Our heroes thanked him and left, returning to the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Skeeve Switched Personalities with the mouse and later with Zachery, so everyone was back in their own body... except the mouse in the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s body. (From here forward, then, it's just a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>. <I>I'm confused</I> by all the body switching!) While Hygulf and Skeeve meditated to regain their strength, Zachery contacted Baron Blackhawk to ask if there might be room around Hu&aelig;tburg to &quot;stable&quot; a tame <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>... The Baron was amused, but wisely put off a decision until he could talk with his counselors. 
</P>
<P>
For the next week, Hygulf and Skeeve (and Zachery at times) meticulously went through the 172,800 cubic feet of junk they had liberated from the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s lair, pulling out the 30 cubic feet or so of really valuable stuff. Meanwhile, Zachery tried to teach the new <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> how to fly. He rigged up a makeshift saddle so that he could ride on its back and they stood on the edge of the crater looking down... Comments from the others were not inspiring. Although, &quot;The sound of great leathery wings... and a loud SQUEAK!&quot; was quite funny. (The mouse still had a tendency to squeak and make mouse noises... using the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s lung capacity to get several hundred decibels.)
</P>
<P>
Once the magical items were determined, Hygulf took them to Rathwyn to identify them. He made a deal: Rathwyn got to keep the Wand of Frost, but identified all the items for free and will cast Stoneskin on our heroes whenever they need it for the next two years. The <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>'s hoard, all told, came to 86,470gp. A breakdown follows:
