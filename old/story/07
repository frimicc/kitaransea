Reaping 25-26:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes decide to part company. Ex-brother Faustus leaves the rest of the
group, who are "off chasing trifles" instead of working to remove the blight of
Bane (as personified by Lord Balzac of Granthar) from the face of the Earth.
The other three realize that they will probably see him again, but since he is
only a "wild talent", he can't possibly understand the true threat posed by
Costanza, the Dark Master, and now the Illithid.
</P>
<P>
We will leave Faustus to his own devices for a while.
</P>
<P>
The remaining heroes decided to travel again to the great Elven library in the
Telos mountains -- but this time they have a plan! Skeeve will use his new
power of Cognitive Trance to help them focus their research towards a few
distinct goals: 1) discovering Costanza's and the Dark Master's plans to take
over the world, 2) finding the weak spots in those plans, and 3) figuring out
what, if anything, the Illithid have to do with those plans. Talk about aiming
high!
</P>
<P>
Anyway, on the way to the library, the Dream Travel had an accident, dropping
our heroes into the edge of a great forest. Luckily they didn't run into any
elves while they waited for Skeeve to regain enough PSPs to complete the trip.
However, they heard through the trees the noise of loggers. Hygulf
metamorphosed into a giant ape to investigate and watched as a team of men cut
down old-growth trees and dragged them back to a small processing village at
the forest's edge. He took no action beyond watching, and the party was ready
to travel again soon.
</P>
<P>
Reaping 26 - Goodmonth 12 (two weeks):
</P>
<P>
Time blurred between the stacks of books in the library, as two weeks passed.
Much was accomplished this trip, so I will merely highlight it here:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Skeeve made a copy of the map of the Underdark that he memorized while
checking out Hygulf's new home.
</LI>
<LI>
Skullport is a horrible, nasty place, run by Illithid and beholders and dark
elves. Several people have been there (including Rathwyn, or so it seems) and
all agree that you can make it as long as you don't stand out -- like a paladin
or something. ;-)
</LI>
<LI>
Illithid, AKA Mind Flayers, are very intelligent and have many magical and
psionic powers including: teleport, plane shift, stunning mind blast, ESP,
domination, and change self. They also have big, nasty tentacles that bore into
your brain. Hygulf decided that he would rather fight Costanza than an Illithid
that could gate in half-a-dozen more rather than lose.
</LI>
<LI>
Brimforirlan is an old elf, seen by Stonne (the librarian) about 500 years
ago and by Rathwyn about 5 years ago. He is a powerful mage and psionicist
according to some, "he seemed like just an old man" to others. Whatever the
case, information about him is highly guarded in the library and could not be
researched without special permission and guards watching over your shoulder.
The elf also is known to have an amulet of proof against detection and location
that makes him nearly impossible to contact. He may also be insane.
</LI>
<LI>
Rathwyn was in the library researching the book brought up from the
Underdark. After his surprise at meeting Skeeve and Hygulf in a place reserved
for mages, he explained that the book looks like it is a very powerful spell
that requires both magic and psionics to cast. (Maybe it used to belong to
Brimforirlan?) The spell looks like it will create a warlike nation from
practically nothing, fanatically loyal to the spellcaster. Such power could
tempt anyone! Luckily, only a few people could ever be able to cast it...
</LI>
<LI>
There is a monastery of psionicists who specialize in Metapsionics in the
deep south, past the great desert. 
</LI>
<LI>
Costanza was seen in Selenica and Skeeve memorized a map of the town. (only a
*little* out of date...) :-)
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Of course, any or all of this may be less than completely true ... 
</P>
<P>
We resume at the end of the two weeks of research. Will our heroes travel to
Selenica to spy on Costanza? Will they travel the Underdark to Skullport in
search of the Illithid? Will they comb the Granos Mountains, looking for
Brimforirlan? We'll find out soon!
</P>

<A NAME="RTFToC22">Twentieth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Goodmonth 12-14, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes were still in the Library today. They examined a number of possible
schemes for Costanza's and the Dark Master's takeover of the world, but could
not decide which was the most likely. More information was needed.
</P>
<P>
Information was found on several of the ruined cities around the Rhu'nada Sea:
Ruander (on an island, destroyed by a huge catastrophe), Tempor (on the eastern
coast, destroyed by a tidal wave ... or at least "swallowed by the sea"), and
Wraith (on the Ruatha river, to the south, destroyed by civil war). Many of the
survivors of these ancient cities are now living as the nomads in the plains to
the east. During some of its last days, Ruander was the capitol of Costanza's
Autarchy, Ruadar. Our heroes thought that they could maybe glean some
information on the destruction of the cities and pick up some ancient artifact
that would help them against Costanza -- if they could check them out. Picking
one at random, Skeeve traveled astrally to Ruander to see what was left.
</P>
<P>
It is a small island, probably only 10 miles or so across. The great city used
to span the entire island, but is now all broken and scavenged. Ships sometimes
stop here on their way from Selenica to the northern port, but mostly the place
is avoided. Few animals live there -- in fact, only birds could be seen or
heard by Skeeve. He examined a number of ruined stone walls, and finally found
the remains of a temple which had fallen in such a way as to leave open a hole
into the rooms buried below. Of course, his astral body merely floated through
the dirt and rock. 
</P>
<P>
Under the temple, Skeeve found two things: a storeroom that used to be an
armory and a mystery. The armory still contained swords, spears, and shields,
and two nice-looking elven short swords. Skeeve tried to take them with, but as
he was astral, couldn't pick anything up. He also found another room that was
shielded from astral travel, deep in the ground nearby. This room is different
from the one under the Granos Mountains in that it has *no* entrance. It is
completely sealed from the outside with no passages leading to it. He went back
to get Hygulf to help check both rooms out.
</P>
<P>
First, however, he checked out a large pool nearby. It seemed to be a perfect
hemisphere -- the sides sloping down to the center. At the bottom, there grew a
giant stalk of alg&aelig;, which resisted Skeeve's astral presence. Something
seemed to be attached to the alg&aelig;, but slightly distinct. Very strange.
Finally, he returned to his body.
</P>
<P>
As they prepared to leave the library, a mage arrived. He said his name was
Beauman of Atrek, and that he was from Athmyr. Nothing he did or said was
unusual, but he seemed to be at least minorly powerful. Then, our heroes dream
traveled to the ruins. A perfect landing put them in front of the temple, by a
large pool. The pool was a half-mile in diameter and looked perfectly round! It
had no stone wall, but seemed dug from the earth. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Hygulf decided to check out the mysterious room first. He became
ectoplasmic and sunk down into the 20 foot cube. Inside, it looked like a
summoner's workshop: pentacle inlaid in the floor, books in cases, lots of jars
and vials sitting around. There were permanent lights at the corners of the
pentagram and a smoky haze near its center. As Hygulf looked around, he heard a
noise. Turning, he saw an old man sitting in the pentagram. The man addressed
him and said, "Could you hand me my glasses?" A pair of glasses lay on a small
table just outside of the circle. Hygulf ignored him and started flipping
through the books. They seemed to be a diary of someone -- possibly of a great
mage who summoned something here. Turning around again, the old man was gone
and in his place was a young girl! "Could you give me my lollipop?" she asked.
On the same little table, there now sat a lollipop. Hygulf raised his eyebrows,
but continued to ignore the girl. He took a few volumes and rose through the
walls back to the surface.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve and Hygulf looked at the books. They detailed the life of a mage who
summoned a "great being" to help "defeat Costanza... but it may already be too
late." The dates were consistent with Costanza's reign in this area. Later on,
the diary became dreary: "It can't help us. We can't get a deal struck. It's
hopeless." Finally, the diary just stopped, a few weeks before the destruction
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Our heroes decided to check out the lake and the swords before returning to the
caged being. They quickly dimension doored to the armory and took the swords.
The swords felt "funny", almost slightly alive, to both of them, but nothing
else happened. We'll have to see how the weapons turn out. *snicker*
</P>
<P>
The pool turned out to be an exact hemisphere! Hygulf metamorphosed into a
giant octopus and swam down into the pool. The sides were unnaturally smooth
and the water felt funny... slightly acidic. At the bottom, the octopus ripped
the alg&aelig; from the ground and threw it out of the pool, to land near the
edge. Hygulf returned to the surface and our heroes examined their find. 
</P>
<P>
The alg&aelig; grew in a resemblance of a human form, with arms outstretched
above its head. The astral "fuzz" had a distinct human form, with two legs and
arms, nearly matching the alg&aelig;. Somehow, the two forms on different
planes were connected. Grasping at straws, Skeeve thought to try to check for
"out of phase" objects. Lo and behold, slightly out of phase from the
alg&aelig; was a woman! She was blond and dressed in a white tunic and sandals,
kind of like the pictures we see now of ancient Greeks. Her mouth was open and
she seemed to be in suspended animation. Hmm...
</P>
<P>
After putting the alg&aelig; back in the water, Hygulf decided to go ask the
being in the pentagram who the person was. He returned to the isolated cube and
told the little girl that he had to see her "real form" to deal with her. She
changed into a elf-like creature with slightly more pointy ears than an elf and
many more teeth (pointy too) and a greenish tint to its skin. He (it changed
sex, too) then had a long and torturous conversation with Hygulf about "deals".
It seems that he had been summoned here to "kill a man", but he could not do it
and they left him here until he said he would. He could not seem to make a deal
with "her", presumably the woman in the alg&aelig;, but he did not corroborate
that. He did not know the man, but had met him once. He did not seem to know
who Costanza was. Every now and then, he asked for "the lollipop", which was
still sitting on the little table outside the circle. Hygulf left with more
questions than he had before.
</P>
<P>
As our heroes were contemplating all this, a small group of slavers happened
upon them. Skeeve became astral and chased them away, but they returned with
their captain, who had a pair of monocles that let him see astral beings! After
a bit of searching, the slavers decided to leave our heroes and returned to
their ship - the Jundir - and sailed off. Skeeve and Hygulf decided to see what
Master Brand could say about all this and left for Hu&aelig;tburg.
</P>
<P>
So, who is the man in the pentacle? Are there *lots* of these protected cubes
just underground? Was the woman mage good or evil? Did she cause the giant
crater or simply get hit by whatever it was? Is slavery becoming more prevalent
in the Rhu'nada Sea area? We'll find out next time!
</P>
