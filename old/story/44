<P>
Goodmonth - Harvester - Brewfest, 1900:
</P>
<P>
First, let's catch up with Zachery. During these months, he actually helped get negotiations going between Beogar and Ket. However, the negotiations didn't go too well... As of Brewfest, Ket was still close to invading Beogar.
</P>
<P>
Also during these months, the merchants in Beogar and the South were preparing to begin trading with one another, through the &quot;gateway&quot; that will be created in C&aelig;lwynn... In more personal matters, Skeeve went to Nethathon, called in a favor, and created a small holding company which shared his and Hygulf's tax-free status. The holding company bought a warehouse and started to make deals to transport the world's goods through Earnsige.
</P>
<P>
Finally, around the beginning of Brewfest, Headmaster Brand came to see our heroes about the Network's response to the plan for a Psionic Academy -- they didn't like it. Someone from the Network would be visiting the next day to talk with the leaders of the school about shutting it down. Hygulf and Skeeve were a bit nervous, but asked Jeffrey to prepare for guests...
</P>
<P>
In the morning, four figures walked through a wormhole in Castle Earnsige's courtyard. Over the next hour, while they were there, Skeeve used his new Aura Sight to estimate their alignments and power levels. The Network's delegates were:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Dorwing, a middle-aged elf, probably from the Ta'Bel'Ran. (True Neutral, high level)</LI>
<LI>Alpanerden, a young Ketite man, wearing stylish black leathers. (Lawful Evil, high level)</LI>
<LI>Parbert, an old Athmyrian man, wearing a robe like a wizard's. (Lawful Good, high level)</LI>
<LI>And a man in fully-covering, off-black robes, with just his old, withered nose appearing beneath the hood... the Dark Master! Skeeve could not read any information from his non-existent aura.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Hygulf, Skeeve, and Brand led them into the keep, where they all sat down for a chat. A relatively short debate followed, where Dorwing, the speaker for the group, convinced our heroes that there was danger in their offer to train psionicists for the local governments. Such attention as it would bring, would end up drawing crowds of lynchers to every center of psionic power. The study of psionics did not need that kind of attention.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, there was a larger enemy: the Illithid. Deep underground, they still were kidnapping spellcasters, slowly but surely, for some unknown purpose. As the only group really strong enough to fight them, the Network planned to begin coordinating an attack. They would lose many psionicists, though, and replacements would need to be trained more quickly than ever before. Thus, the school that the Illuminati were founding would still be used... just for the Network instead of any particular country.
</P>
<P>
When the Network representatives left, our heroes were still founding a school, but in relative secrecy. Hygulf and Skeeve wrote follow-up letters to the leaders of Wayland, Athmyr, and Beogar, rescinding their offer of psionic training. &quot;It just isn't feasible for us to take students from you yet.&quot; Skeeve took off for the great Library, to research the illithid, and Hygulf began to prepare a psionic item that would help them in the future.
</P>
<P>
What will happen next time? Lots of info on illithid, to be sure. Be here next week!
</P>
