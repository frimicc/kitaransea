Patchwall 7-10, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes decided to check out a farmstead on the river, near the edge of the
huge forest. Maybe the farmer had seen something of the missing Jelenneth. It
turns out that the farm is owned by one of three rangers, who patrol and
protect the shire from various enemies. Kuiper, the ranger here, is in charge
of the forest and surrounding areas. He claimed that he hadn't seen anything
himself, but maybe a local druid, Oleanne, who lives in the forest, might have
seen something.
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Kuiper, Zachery, and Hygulf set off into the forest,
following Boar Creek (or similar name not in front of me right now) for most of
the day. Their mission was twofold: to look for caves that might lead down into
the underdark, and to find the druid. They didn't find any caves, but Oleanne
found them.
</P>
<P>
She is wild, and speaks with an unplaceable accent. Hygulf and her connected
over the few phrases of the Druid's Cant that he knew. She said that she had
not seen anything of the missing woman, but she *had* found a young boy who had
been turned into a werebear -- and he needed to be captured. Kuiper suggested
that our heroes could help capture the werebear, while looking for caves
further in the forest. Oleanne led the group deep into the forest, until
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
In camp, Zachery and Hygulf made good use of their time. Hygulf remembered
seeing a human on watch at the ruins in the middle of the forest, so Zachery
contacted him. His name is "George", and he is the lookout for a group of
bandits who live in the ruined keep. While in his mind, Zachery learned several
things:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
he saw only four bandits, but their leader is obvious: he has a black eye
patch. 
</LI>
<LI>
a young man is being cruelly treated by the bandits, hazing mostly. 
</LI>
<LI>
George was part of the group that kidnapped Jelenneth! He remembers carrying
her into a tunnel just on the forest-side of the river and then leaving her in
a cell under the ruined keep. 
</LI>
<LI>
the young man, Heydrus, imagined a map of the keep for our heroes to
remember. They tried to write it down, but who knows how accurate it is? 
</LI>
<LI>
The leader of the bandits' mind explained a lot of things: mages are being
captured and given to Illithid, who lead them far down into the underdark.
Really nasty fish are involved, somehow.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Near morning, the camp was attacked by a group of bloodskull orcs. They were
fended off, but some wounds were taken by our heroes. Then, the group went to
capture the werebear...
</P>
<P>
Kuiper had a good idea, to net the bear while he drew its attacks, but Hygulf
and Zachery would have none of that! Zachery used Invincible Foes on the poor
creature, and then Hygulf tried to punch it to knock it out. Since they didn't
tell Kuiper what they were doing, he thought they were trying to kill the boy!
So, in the end, he realized that they were mindwitches and left -- leaving them
stuck in the middle of the forest.
</P>
<P>
With their next step unknown, Zachery contacted Jelenneth again. This time, she
was in a place with some light - she had been marched through a city of Kuo-Toa
with Illithid and large, flying manta-ray-like fish. The place looked jammed
with evil creatures, and the mages were used as slaves. In her cell, were about
20 other people, some sick and wounded, all waiting to be transferred to lower
depths...
</P>
<P>
So, the discussion to save them commenced. Our heroes decided to teleport to an
area on the ground, directly above the place where the slaves are being held.
Then, Zachery contacted Faustus and had him teleport to join them. From here,
they can teleport down into the depths, grab the prisoners, and come back... if
they can do it fast enough, without being seen!
</P>
<P>
Be here next time, when we watch our heroes being attacked by hordes of Kuo-Toa
and the dreaded Illithid! Fun, fun!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC36">Thirty-Fourth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Patchwall 11-12, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes spent about 24 hours and made two trips down into the Underdark to
get 8 slaves of the Kuo-Toa. They saved Jelenneth and a paladin of Tyr named
Geronmen, who was severely wounded. (Dying, in fact)
</P>
<P>
Amazingly enough, no one caught our heroes in their trips, but it might have
been luck more than skill that caused that outcome...
</P>
<P>
Up top, Faustus laid hands on Geronmen, and healed him a little - but not
enough. Hygulf used his cell adjustment to completely heal the wounded
paladin... Then, they all had to convince Geronmen that Psionics weren't as bad
has he had heard. In the end, he decided to join our heroes as Faustus's
follower.
</P>
<P>
Once that was decided, Faustus, Zachery, and Hygulf took Jelenneth back to
Milborne and received their reward: 100 gp each.
</P>
<P>
Zachery kept his.
</P>
Faustus donated it to the local Church of Tyr, and had a *fascinating* chat
with the local cleric about why Faustus had been thrown out of the church.<P>
Hygulf gave it back to the town, but only on the condition that they work to
stop polluting the river with mine tailings.
</P>
<P>
Then, our heroes returned to Hu&aelig;tburg for some training and rest. :-)
</P>
<P>
Next time: Faustus goes to the capitol of Beogar to ask for an army to attack
the Kuo-Toa. Hygulf spends two months in meditation to become more wise. And
Zachery??? We'll see.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC37">Thirty-Fifth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Patchwall 13-15, 1899:
</P>
<P>
This time, most attention settled on Faustus. But, some other things happened,
too.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf visited Rathwyn, the court mage of Hu&aelig;tburg, and received "the
book" back. He took the book back to where it came from, and hid it there.
Since he was wearing the amulet the whole time, no one can now trace where the
book is...
</P>
<P>
(The book is the one found in a secured place, a room that cannot be teleported
into or visited astrally or etherially. It contains the formula for a spell
that can raise an entire nation into worshipful, fanatical followers of the
caster. The caster must be both an archmage and an archpsionicist, though, but
Rathwyn thinks that it could be cast by two people, one of each...)
</P>
<P>
Hygulf and Zachery holed up to meditate for 50 days, to become wiser in the
ways of psionics. They are in the cave in the mountains that Hygulf and Skeeve
found a while ago.
</P>
<P>
Now for Faustus:
</P>
<P>
He helped Geronmen, his new faithful follower, get a full suit of plate mail
from the Baron, and then they teleported to C&aelig;lwynn to ask the King if he
could send an army to defeat the Illithid/Kuo-Toa/other who are stealing mages
from the surface world.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Faustus learned that the King had recently had a falling out with
the court mage, due to a failed experiment. Also, Lawgiver Eadlund, the court
priest of Tyr, had been preaching against mages for some time. So, there were
no mages allowed in the castle, and many had left C&aelig;lwynn altogether.
</P>
<P>
Faustus and Geronmen had an audience with the King, through Geronmen's old
friend Brigadier Earnlaf. However, the King seemed more interested in a crusade
against Ket than in fighting the underground menace.
</P>
<P>
To determine the truth of this, Faustus asked Zachery to.. read the King's
mind! (You know, Faustus is moving more and more towards the expedient instead
of the "church proper".. It's good to see that his friends are having such a
great impact on him. :-) )
</P>
<P>
Zachery discovered that the King was thinking about using the tunnels under the
mountains to launch an attack on Ket, instead of fighting the Illithid. Also,
he seemed heavily swayed by the Church, to begin the crusade against Ket.
</P>
<P>
But, in the morning, Faustus heard the worst news of all:
</P>
<P>
The King had died! (may he rest in peace, in the judgment of Tyr)
</P>
<P>
The crown prince was being recalled from his post for the last six months... as
ambassador to Selenica. In Selenica, he had so impressed the mayor, that he was
sure that troops would be promised from there to help Beogar in the upcoming
war against Ket. In fact, an honor guard from Selenica would accompany the new
King on his return journey.
</P>
<P>
Be there next time, when we meet the new King and find out if he has been...
dominated!
</P>
