Reaping 4 - 10, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Again, the long-awaited assault on Castle Earnsige... almost.
</P>
<P>
First, Hygulf managed to change himself back to his normal shape. However, while he was occupied with this, the assassin "wandered off" into the Underdark tunnels. The next day, he went into the tunnels looking for her and found no trace. He did discover some strange symbols painted on the walls of every tunnel, at a distance of about a half-hour's walk from the entrance...
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Skeeve and Zachery were busy with the dwarves in Kar-agun. The duke welcomed them in to the middle of a party for the birth of his new grandson - "Dunin". (yes, pronounced like "done in"... it's a perfectly good dwarven name!) Our heroes joined in the festivities, but Zachery claimed he could not drink any of the ubiquitous Dwarven Ale for religious reasons. Luckily the dwarves didn't press very hard on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The next morning, they met with the Duke and discussed their proposal: a small army of dwarves to fight the horde of orcs back at Castle Coensige. The Duke was not very attracted to the deal, but in the end he agreed to send troops -- in return for the scales to make two suits of dragon armor! 
</P>
<P>
First, though, he needed better intelligence than Skeeve and Zachery could offer. He sent two of his best scouts back to Coensige with our heroes to "get the lay of the land" and estimate how many dwarves would be required. The two dwarves, Munin and Forbrinok, were uneasy about using Skeeve's wormhole, but the minute they arrived outside the castle, they started thinking of great ways to use wormholes in battle... Skeeve did not like the sound of that!
</P>
<P>
As usual, it was difficult to get in to see Lord Eadbalth. Our heroes were first stopped at the front lines and again outside the war room. Skeeve spoke quickly and the guards let them through. Inside, Lord Eadbalth and his advisors were happy to see the dwarves. They gave a detailed briefing to the scouts, who seemed excited about their prospects for success. To get more detailed information, the scouts turned to Skeeve, who travelled to the orc camp astrally and replayed the images to the scouts upon his return. The dwarves said they had enough information to plan their attack and Skeeve took them all back to Kar-agun.
</P>
<P>
The scouts said it would take a couple of days to make plans with the Duke, so Skeeve and Zachery made themselves at home in the "tall" section of the caverns, in guest quarters. While they waited, Zachery contacted Hygulf to see how he fared. 
</P>
<P>
Hygulf explained that he had lost the assassin. Since he was not a telepath, he could not contact her to find out where she was... Zachery could, though, and did. The assassin didn't particularly want to be contacted, but she did chat for a bit. Zachery looked through her eyes and saw that she was riding on a barge down some large underground river. The barge was crewed by orcs and a troll! The assassin didn't seem to be in any danger, though, and said she was going to bring Zachery back a "present" when she returned in a day or so. Very interesting...
</P>
<P>
So, Hygulf teleported to Kar-agun to wait with the others. Shortly after he arrived, the Duke came down to talk with our heroes. The Duke proposed a military alliance between them -- the Illuminati would use their mental powers to transport the dwarven army, to move supplies into hard to reach places, and perform quick communications during battle, while the dwarves would find some way to repay them. Our heroes weren't too excited about making a permanent alliance with the dwarves, but Zachery did finally remember Dhak -- and offered to include him in the Castle Coensige plans. The Duke left, but left his offer on the table for later.
</P>
<P>
The next day, the assassin returned to the crater around noon and was teleported to Kar-agun to join everyone else. She carried two small packages, which she gave to Hygulf and Zachery. (Skeeve was left out. Poor Skeeve!) Hygulf had a selection of new poisons to make antidotes for and Zachery received a Wand of Wonder! "Just what I've <I>always</I> wanted!" Zachery said. The assassin said she knew the gifts would be useful in the near future...
</P>
<P>
The following day, our heroes continued to wait for the dwarves. Hygulf spent the time using Poison Simulation to get his body used to the new poisons. Zachery decided he had to warn Lord Eadbalth about the giant <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Red Dragon</FONT> that would be coming to the battle. Eadbalth was initially frightened and more than a little suspicious, but in the end he said that it would be OK. He would let his troops know that a "friendly" dragon would be arriving.
</P>
<P>
After another couple of days, our heroes received word that the dwarves were ready. The Duke called them out to the main hall to see the 300 dwarves arrayed for battle. They were led by his best captain, Dworin, and had been hand-picked to fight orcs. The group was mainly axe-dwarves, but they also had a small catapult and crew with them. Engineers and support staff (cooks, tailors, a smith, and a cleric) rounded out the group. Every dwarf was ready to go kill some orcs!
</P>
<P>
When all was prepared, Zachery contacted Lord Eadbalth and let him know that the dwarves would be arriving in his courtyard. The lord asked for a few hours to clear space for 300 to bed down overnight, so several hours later Skeeve opened a massive wormhole and led the dwarves through to Castle Coensige. Hygulf and Zachery teleported to Dhak's last known location, outside C&aelig;lwynn, to pick him up. Dhak was very happy to see Zachery and seemed to be even a little more dragon-like than before; when they found him, he was sitting on a rock spire, staring up at the early moon Luna, looking very much like an ancient great wyrm should look. Zachery was proud. Time was short, though, so they wormholed to a spot in the mountains outside Coensige to wait for the battle to start in the morning.
</P>
<P>
So, will we finally start the battle next time? Watch this space to find out!
