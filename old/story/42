Reaping 20 - 27, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Let's catch up with Zachery. He was called back to Gothos to meet with the Emperor right after the Siege of Coensige was ended. During that meeting, Zachery discovered that Ket had created a group of psionicists to work with the army, similar to the Knights of the Mind in Beogar. This group, however, was absolutely secret -- with no uniforms or official mandate -- and was under the auspices of the Red Hand, the Emperor's personal guards and assassins. Right now, these psionicists were trying to find a way to transport the entire Ketite army across the Granos Mountains to attack Alhwick. They had already found a route through the mountains that would let several Teleporters open short wormholes for a long time, so the entire army could pass through. But, the last parts of the trip had not yet been decided. The Emperor wanted Zachery to use his knowledge of Beogaran tactics to help create the strategy and coordinate the offensive.
</P>
<P>
Zachery said he would much rather negotiate with Beogar instead. Given a little time, he thought that he could get them to avoid a proper war. The Emperor told him that negotiations had already failed, but he would be provide a list of demands that Zachery could take to Beogar, if he chose to. Grand Vizier Erdun would have the list and would also be in charge of the psionicists in the Red Hand.
</P>
<P>
So Zachery spoke with the Grand Vizier. While he was there, he asked Erdun some questions about his background and family. The Grand Vizier was cagey with his answers. His family is &quot;not well-known and not from around here&quot;. And he said he was not Psionic. Zachery attempted to contact him, to see if his mental signature matched the one for the Dark Master, but Erdun was uncontactable. He must have an Amulet of Non-Detection... 
</P>
<P>
Looking over the list of demands, Zachery became a bit disheartened: a hundred slaves twice a year, lots of gold and gems, sell 30% of farm output to Ket, and more, everything to Ket's favor. Finally, he found a teleporter who was willing to transport him, a man named Maaroc. Maaroc and Zachery teleported to C&aelig;lwynn to present his request for negotiation to King Hrethrew. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we return to Faustus, who has been quite busy during the last seven months, travelling around the lands to the South. He has learned much about the language and customs of those strange lands. While in the capitol, a sprawling metropolis of a city with hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, Faustus got an audience with the Sultan, the king of the southern lands. Faustus asked the Sultan for two boons: first, to allow him to set up a trading pact between the South and the North, and second, to search the Royal treasury for a magic sword, the fabled Psionic Avenger, which lets the wielder fight psionicists on a more even footing. The Sultan agreed to both requests. &quot;If the sword is in our treasury, you may have it to use against the evil psionicists in the North,&quot; he said. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us up-to-date with Skeeve and Hygulf. Faustus contacted King Hrethrew of Beogar about setting up a meeting of merchants from Beogar with merchants from the South. The king was most agreeable to this and said that he could gather the merchants in a week's time. Faustus asked his contacts in the South to do the same. Both groups would meet at the Monastery of El-Akbar, in a week. Mere moments later, Skeeve contacted the King to propose setting up new trading relations with the South, with travel passing through Castle Earnsige. The King suggested Skeeve talk with Faustus.
</P>
<P>
So Skeeve contacted Faustus and arranged to meet him at the monastery immediately. After catching up on what had gone before (Faustus was excited that Costanza had been defeated, but Skeeve didn't tell him the entire story...), the two discussed the possibilities of trade. Skeeve talked Faustus into speaking with the King about using Earnsige as a transit center, the next day. 
</P>
<P>
As Skeeve popped back to Earnsige, he was contacted by Zachery! Since Zachery was going to come to C&aelig;lwynn, he wanted to catch up with his companions. Skeeve wormholed to meet him and Maaroc as they appeared outside the dragon stable, just outside of C&aelig;lwynn. They spoke at length about the likelyhood of war between Ket and Beogar, and what Zachery had discovered about the Grand Vizier. Skeeve looked at Zachery's image of Erdun and noticed that it matched almost exactly to his long-ago view of the Dark Master... Zachery wasn't as sure, though. The three walked through the city to the Castle and their waiting rooms.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Faustus teleported to C&aelig;lwynn to meet with Skeeve and the King. They argued about the trade agreement because the King was adamant: if a permanent portal was to be made to the South, then it should be created in his castle. In C&aelig;lwynn was the only place where it could be properly defended against all attacks, especially in this time of cold war with Ket. Skeeve and Faustus left, saying that they will at least have the meeting in a week and see if the merchants can come up with reasonable deals.
</P>
<P>
Then, Zachery had his meeting with the King. The King said that he would never accept Ket's terms, since they would amount to paying tribute to an overlord. &quot;And, no Beogaran will be forced into slavery, ever!&quot; he said. Zachery countered that the terms were merely a starting point for negotiations. If only Beogar would be willing to talk, maybe war could be averted. Finally, the King agreed to release a few political prisoners from Ket as a gesture of good faith. Zachery promised to get a similar release from Ket, or at least to try.
</P>
<P>
On his way out, Zachery and Faustus got together. Strong words passed between them; tears may have been shed. Faustus was furious at Zachery's working for Ket, Zachery thought Faustus should have contacted him more during his travels. It was obvious to Skeeve that they still felt the same way towards each other as they had at their last meeting -- attracted and repelled. Finally, Faustus left in a huff and teleported back to the South to set up the meeting. Zachery left with Maaroc to Gothos, to attempt to secure the release of prisoners. Skeeve went back to Earnsige, to fill in Hygulf on the plans.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the week, everything was happier. Zachery managed to secure the release of a similar number of Beogaran prisoners from Ket and Faustus even talked the King into setting up a meeting between him and the Church of Tyr, in light of his great contribution to the Beogaran economy. The merchants agreed in principle to a way of doing business between the lands, with the monastery as a neutral point in-between. All that was left to do was to figure out the details of <b>how</b> goods would travel from the monastery to Beogar...
