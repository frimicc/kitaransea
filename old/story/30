Wealsun 19 - 23, 1900:
</P>
<P>
The assassin &quot;wandered off&quot; while Hygulf distracted Sylea, our heroes' elven Library assistant. Hygulf asked if there was a scrying-proof room he could use for a couple of hours...
</P>
<P>
Sylea quickly found such a room and Hygulf dragged Zachery and Skeeve out of bed to try out some tactics he had thought up for attacking Costanza. Since our heroes would have to deliver the book to him, it would be a great excuse to get close enough to stop his evil plans.
</P>
<P>
In the scrying-proof room, even the auto-books would not record their practice, so no word could reach Costanza... Who knows what they talked about in there? This chronicle cannot say.
</P>
<P>
After two hours in the room, our heroes emerged and headed for some sleep. Along the way, Skeeve contacted the assassin and asked her to meet them back at their rooms, so that Sylea wouldn't notice she had been gone.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, our heroes awoke to the news that a giant storm was tearing through the mountains, so no one could enter or leave the Library until it passed. Within the cavernous space, though, no sound of wind nor thunder could be heard... To be sure, Hygulf poked his nose outside for a moment and nearly fell as the wind whipped and the rain slashed down. They would have to wait before going to see Costanza.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, our heroes decided to take their plan to Stonne, the Librarian, and ask him what he thought their chances of success were. Stonne looked them straight in the eyes and mentioned again that the Prison Plane wasn't so bad...
</P>
<P>
Stonne also mentioned some information that had been gleaned from Costanza's auto-book, while it had been available: Costanza always keeps a couple of huge bodyguards and at least two psionicists with him at all times. However, he has a weakness for beautiful women. Still, the Librarian's only helpful thought was to use several wishes to stop Costanza. &quot;Anything less and he will just be resurrected,&quot; he said.
</P>
<P>
Their hopes slightly dampened, our heroes decided to wait a little longer to see if a fake <i>Tome of Martek</i> could be created and to hone their plans for Costanza...
</P>
<P>
Will they finally confront their long-term enemy? What is this new tactic they were practicing? Be here next time and find out!
</P>
