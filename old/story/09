<P>
Month, day of 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes entered the dwarven stronghold of Kar-agun today. Through the giant
doors was a huge hall with many smaller tunnels and balconies. The party was
greeted and sent to their rooms -- and the door was locked behind them.
</P>
<P>
Every thing our heroes asked for was provided, it was just that the dwarves
don't trust humans very much. Shortly, they were coached and sent to meet the
Duke of Kar-agun. (Dwarven ritual doesn't make much sense to humans, especially
to those that don't drink. ;-) ) Surprisingly, the audience went well, even
though Faustus became drunk and nearly stumbled on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
Directly afterward, Faustus and Hygulf were taken to the local Church of Tyr.
(Some, but only a few, dwarves worship Tyr.) The priest explained that Tyr had
given them a dispensation to drink alcoholic beverages, but Faustus is still
having problems with it. Then they looked into the history of the crown that
Faustus recovered from the Orc Chief.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf grew bored, and asked their guide to take him somewhere. They went to a
bar on "Level 1", where Hygulf had the required rituals for the crown's
recovery explained:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Many orcs will be killed, enough to pile higher than a pole the height of the
number of years the crown has been lost. (it's been lost for hundreds or
thousands of years)
</LI>
<LI>
Parties and celebrations will be held for weeks, but our heroes need only
attend for a few days.
</LI>
<LI>
The crown must be presented to the Duke at a huge ceremony, involving large
quantities of beer. (a problem for Faustus :-) )
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Later, our heroes were escorted back to their quarters. There they found a
message from the imp's master [...] asking to meet them in an eating area on
level 4. It was after the meeting time, but our heroes went anyway.
</P>
<P>
There they met with a dwarven wizard (who looked human to Inforanel's True
Sight). He thanked them for plunging the orcs into chaos and said that he owes
them a favor. All they need to do is call his name in the Underdark, and he
will find them. It is thought that he is evil, but "the enemy of my enemy is my
friend" may be appropriate here. *snicker*
</P>
<P>
Month, day of 1899:
</P>
<P>
The next morning, the Duke called a personal, informal audience with our heroes
to discuss matters. Everyone opened up with the truth, and Hygulf told the Duke
of their mission to find Brimforirlan. (known as Dworkin to the dwarves here)
The Duke saw the crown and was pleased. He will help our heroes to find
Dworkin, as quickly as possible. Our heroes also discovered that the Duke used
to adventure with Baron Blackhawk, long ago.
</P>
<P>
So, what else don't they know? Will they find the mad elf? Who is this false
dwarven wizard, anyway? How will Faustus act when drunk? We'll find out next
week!

</H2>
<P>
Month, Day of 1899:
</P>
<P>
(it all looks the same when you're underground!)
</P>
<P>
Our heroes spent the day preparing for the giant ceremony to return the Crown
of Ollorin to the dwarves tomorrow. Luckily, Faustus only had to say a few
words, and they had been scripted by the translators. He memorized his speech
well. 
</P>
<P>
However, that night, four dwarves came into our heroes' room, posing as guards.
They didn't speak any Common, so Hygulf and Faustus just left them alone (but
kept an eye on them). As the Dwarven porter, Munin, finally returned with
dinner, the dwarves attacked! One of them shot Munin in the throat with a
quarrel, the others attacked our heroes. 
</P>
<P>
It was a short battle, but the dwarves managed to wound both Hygulf and
Faustus. Just as the last one went down, the *real* dwarven authorities arrived
and carried them away. Munin was taken to the clerics for healing, after some
life-saving healing from Hygulf. It turns out that the dwarves were from a
rebel organization seeking to discredit the humans by stealing the crown. Then,
the other dwarves would think that they had been lied to and join this faction
in hating humans.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, no other attacks occurred. The next day, the ceremony went off
without any trouble, except for our heroes constant amazement at the dwarven
customs. For example, the members of the faction that had attacked them were to
be beheaded during the dinner. All the dwarves cheered, but Faustus and Hygulf
were repulsed.
</P>
<P>
After the meal, and a rousing speech by Duke Gonbard, all the dwarves ran off
to prepare their weapons to go out and kill lots of orcs, in revenge for them
having stolen the crown thousands of years ago. Our heroes decided to get the
jump on the dwarves and teleported to the chambers of the Cyric Orc Chieftain
Nazgar...
</P>
<P>
With his amazing psionic powers, Hygulf became a one-man army, killing Nazgar
in nearly one round! Then, Faustus lopped off his head as a trophy. Of course,
neither of our heroes had come up with a plan to escape! So, they Dimension
Doored randomly, to get away from the twenty or so Orcs in the throne room.
Luckily, only two of Nazgar's personal guards were able to follow them. They
were dispatched with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
That left our heroes lost, out of power, and with a horde of orcs on their tail
-- in the Underdark. (scary music) As they ran from the suspected pursuers,
they turned some ghouls, killed some gnolls, and ran past a slew of goblins.
Finally, our heroes found a room to hole up in and sleep for 12 hours to get
back some power. 
</P>
<P>
While they rested, the orcs found their hiding place and tried to break in, but
were defeated. With just enough power for one teleport, a noise came in from
the hallway... a TROLL!! Acting fast, Faustus made the teleport roll and our
heroes were safe in the dwarven stronghold of Kar-agun, again. *whew*
</P>
<P>
So, what will they do for an encore? Kill more orcs? Follow their tracker to
find Brimforirlan? Seek out more monsters/treasure/magic in the Underdark?
We'll find out this week!

</H2>
<P>
Harvester xx, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes visited Munin, the poor dwarf who had been nearly killed for opening
a door, before they left Kar-agun in search of Brimforirlan. They were assigned
Kulkai, a dwarven scout/tracker to guide them and help them survive in the
forbidding mountains.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after departing, it started to rain. As they sat in the shelter of
a ledge, Kulkai explained some more things about the dwarves that lived in the
Granos Mountains: Since Beogar and Ket both lay claim to the area, the dwarves
try to live in peace with both sides. They trade with both sides, too. (This
angered Faustus, but he held still. ;-) ) In fact, one of the trade delegations
a while ago had the mystery woman, the third one of the Dark Master's group, as
a leading member. But, there was no time to ask the Duke about her -- our
heroes had to go on to the last known haunt of Dworkin (Brimforirlan).
</P>
<P>
Along the way, a Ket patrol found the three travelers: Kulkai, Faustus, and
Hygulf. They seemed to not want any trouble -- until they asked for a bribe. On
the advice of Kulkai, our heroes pooled their money and paid enough to let them
pass the patrol. One can only assume that the same situation holds true for any
group of travelers in the mountains -- not a happy thought. Luckily, the
Ketites didn't discover that our heroes are from Beogar, or there would have
been a battle!
</P>
<P>
Harvester xx+1, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Finally, after a night's rest, our heroes found their way into a crater on the
top of a mountain peak. A lake filled the area, with trees around. A small
shack sat near the lake, with a note on the front door in Ketish. Since none of
them read Ketish, they just opened the door and went in. Inside were a number
of books and another note. A long time later, through use of True Sight by
Inforanel, Hygulf's sword, our heroes discovered the details.
</P>
<P>
Dworkin (Brimforirlan) was here, studying the fish in the lake, for the last 5
years or so. He found much of interest, including a bunch of stuff about evil,
intelligent fish that are working with the Illithid to take over the world! He
was also writing some magical spells or potion recipes. The note on the desk
said that he had gone to "the library" and would be back in a couple of months.
The note on the door said to "Beware! Dangerous magical traps inside!",
obviously to keep people out.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes spent the night. During the night, Hygulf heard a noise outside and
saw a light on the other side of the lake. He woke Faustus and they moved to
investigate. Around the lake, our heroes found a man in a heavy cloak watching
them. Since he didn't seem very helpful in explaining his presence, they
followed him to his camp. He claims that he was an assistant of sorts for
Dworkin. He was also investigating the lake and the fish people. He knew that
Dworkin had left, but didn't know when or where he had done so. 
</P>
<P>
Then Faustus discovered that he was evil... Hygulf restrained him, but Faustus
still walked over to the man's books and burned a Mask Holy book. (Mask is the
deity of thieves.) Under pain of Faustus, the man decided to convert to Tyr
right then and there and swore that he would never again associate himself with
evil. Of course, Hygulf (and anyone else not blinded by fanaticism) knows that
he was probably lying, to save his hide. C'est la guerre. However, our heroes
found no evidence contrary to the man's claims, so they let him go and went
back to the shack to wait for morning when they will leave for the Library.
</P>
<P>
What happens next? Is Brimforirlan at the Library? Will he talk with our
heroes? Will he listen? Is he really mad? We'll find out next time!
</P>
