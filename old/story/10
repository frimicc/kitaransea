Harvester 8-14, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes arrived at the Library and found that very little had changed. They
immediately asked about Brimforirlan, and were told that "The Old One" would
not see them. Not taking this well, Faustus and Hygulf asked to see Stonne, the
Librarian, to see what he could do about it. Stonne told them that "The Old
One" had left strict orders not to be disturbed by *anyone*, but Stonne would
see if he would speak with our heroes. All they had to do was wait.
</P>
<P>
Since they had time on their hands, our heroes looked for more information on
Costanza -- and found nothing that they hadn't found before. Except that
Costanza had picked up an Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location, and
now wore it, making him nearly impossible to find. One of the auto-books showed
the tale of a group of elven adventurers who had just arrived in Selenica, but
no mention of Costanza. Although, they *did* seem surprised at how smoothly
everything was in the town... as if all the people were of one mind about
things...
</P>
<P>
Finally, after about a week of waiting, Brimforirlan decided to see them. The
assistant librarian assigned to them led them up many levels of the library, to
a high tower with a single study at the top. The aide left them at the bottom
of the stairs, too afraid to go up. Our heroes were not afraid, and ascended to
meet "The Old One".
</P>
<P>
Brimforirlan looked like a middle-aged elf, but had a few tell-tale traits that
marked him as much older. He knew who Faustus and Hygulf were, and why they had
come to see him, but he did not accept their task of getting rid of Costanza.
Faustus explained as much as he could about the Dark Master and the returned
Autarch, but Brimforirlan seemed to not care. He seemed surprised that Costanza
had taken over the town of Selenica, but it might have been an act. He offered
our heroes some small advice, and sent them on their way. He said, "Good luck."
</P>
<P>
Our heroes did not mention the book they found in the Granos Mountains, and
other things. So, it looked like there would be no help from the infamous
Brimforirlan. Hygulf even offered to help him on his quest against the
fish-people, but was rebuffed. Over all, not a good conversation.
</P>
<P>
So, our heroes decided to re-gather the group and return to Hu&aelig;tburg to
plan their next move.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC30">Twenty-Eighth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Harvester 15, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Busy times for our heroes! Leaving the Library, Faustus and Hygulf teleported
to Gothos to pick up Zachery. Of course, Zachery made it hard on Faustus by
asking for him to "come up to my room." Hygulf went in instead, but was sent
back out shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
While he was gone, Faustus had been accosted by a number of street children. He
gave them all the money he had, but they wanted more. So, he started to tell
them a story. He only got about four sentences in when morals came up... As he
tried to explain to the children about Tyr and being good, several adults had
come by to see what was happening. One of them, a *big* man, took affront at
Faustus's notion that Bane was a false god. The crowd looked on as he
challenged Faustus to a duel. Everyone waited while the man, named Bilard, ran
home to get his weapons and armor. Hygulf stepped into the street just in time
to see Bilard walking down the street towards Faustus, looking as if he would
rip the paladin in two.
</P>
<P>
So, after betting heavily on Faustus, Hygulf stepped around the corner and
Dimension Doored back to Zachery's room. Zachery was worried about Faustus, so
he contacted Bilard and used Invincible Foes on him. So, after remarkably few
blows, the man went down. The crowd roared and Hygulf and Zachery tried to
collect Faustus to leave. But, two young toughs came forward, yelling that
Faustus had killed their father and they were going to kill him! Of course,
they didn't have a chance of hurting Faustus in his armor, but Hygulf and
Zachery were not willing to take a chance -- they stopped the two kids,
physically and psionically, in time for the City Watch to arrive. Our heroes
bustled out of the way and Dimension Doored back into the Inn of the Red
Lanterns.
</P>
<P>
However, since Bilard was not dead, he woke up and started shouting for his
opponent. Faustus heard him through the walls of the Inn, and contacted his
mind, challenging him to finish the duel outside of the city that night. Hygulf
and Zachery tried to stop him, but failed to dissuade him. Bilard had
blasphemed Tyr! He had to die!
</P>
<P>
So, later, Faustus and Hygulf went to meet with the foe. Zachery stayed in his
room, and contacted the others as soon as they neared the spot of the fight.
(Our heroes discovered, as well, that in Ket the highway robbers wear the
livery of the watch.) This time the fight was even quicker, due to Hygulf's
sneaky application of Double Pain and another round of Invincible Foes. As soon
as he was down, Bilard's sons begged for his life, but to no avail. They left
carrying his body to be buried in the Baneite cemetery. Faustus refused to
return to the city, so he and Hygulf traveled away from Gothos to a small
village nearby. They stayed that night in Urthoc.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Faustus contacted Zachery and told him that he had had a dream
about his bonded mount and was off to find it. Hygulf turned into an eagle and
started the long flight to Hu&aelig;tburg. Meanwhile, Zachery had garbled
memories of the early-morning mindlink, so he went to Urthoc to find the
others. There, he found no one but the baffled Innkeeper. He contacted Hygulf,
discovered what had happened, and then set forth for Hu&aelig;tburg himself. 
</P>
<P>
Harvester 17-22, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Traveling the fastest, Hygulf reached Hu&aelig;tburg the next day. There he met
Grimden, who had been sent to find our heroes and take them on a mission for
the Network, spying in Selenica. 
</P>
<P>
Zachery traveled by carriage, ship, and carriage again. He hated Alhwick, the
center of all Tyr worship, and thought that the city was a waste. On the ship,
he met a strange man named Tolliver, who rode in the other cabin on board.
During the whole four days of the trip, he never once emerged from his cabin.
Something inside glowed, too...
</P>
<P>
Faustus had initially teleported to a place he had seen in his dream. From
there, he saw a flight of pegasi fly to the nearby mountains and knew that he
had to go to them. He walked and climbed for days, without any food or
equipment. On his first night, he was challenged by an Ogre. On his second
night, he was challenged by a man called Athden, who didn't attack him, but
turned out to be a werewolf looking to be loosed from his curse. Since Faustus
couldn't help him, but wanted to, Athden left him before nightfall. On the
third night, Faustus was attacked by an Owlbear! The creature nearly killed him
twice, but a little luck and Tyr's blessing allowed Faustus to defeat it. The
fourth night, the grueling climb left him at the mountain top, in a nesting
area of pegasi! He wandered around and saw the leader of the herd... a huge
white pegacorn -- a pegasus with a unicorn's horn. The animal met him, spoke
his name, and then let him mount and fly off into the sunset...
</P>
<P>
So, next week we try to sneak a pegacorn into Selenica! See you then!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC31">Twenty-Ninth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Harvester 22-24, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Faustus and his mount fly back to Hu&aelig;tburg. The others wait and discuss
what to do next.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of the 24th, Faustus returns -- drawing a fantastic crowd to
watch him land in the town square on his Pegacorn! Everybody knows he is back,
and everyone wants to ride on "the pony"... Meanwhile, Hygulf talks with
Rathwyn about the book that our heroes left with him to study. Rathwyn has
determined that it *is* a Psionic/Spell that will create an entire nation of
nearly fanatical followers, more powerful than any known spell. Hygulf recovers
the book, and Rathwyn gives it up willingly. It seems that Rathwyn's research
may have drawn the interest of some powerful mages...
</P>
<P>
Faustus meets with Baron Blackhawk, and explains the Pegacorn. Everyone is
invited to a feast that the Baron is giving in our heroes' honor that night. At
the feast, Hygulf spies "the assassin", the elusive foe-friend of him and
Skeeve. They talk for a while, until Faustus joins in and turns the discussion
to theology. The assassin (who gives her name as Seleton) claims to be a
follower of Tyr from a nearby town. It's close, but Faustus does *not* actually
detect evil... *whew!*
</P>
<P>
Harvester 25, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes rest and meditate during the day, preparing to kill Lord Balzac, the
evil paladin of Bane, the next day. Plans are created and discarded, but Hygulf
and Faustus settle on one that may cause dissension between Costanza and the
Dark Master: they will kill Lord Balzac while disguised as Costanza, and making
sure that there is at least one witness. :-) That night they teleport to the
village of Granthar, where Lord Balzac is laying siege to the castle that was
once his.
</P>
<P>
Harvester 26-27, 1899:
</P>
<P>
THE BIG DAY! Early on, our heroes make a short teleport to Balzac's tent and
try to goad him into turning against the Dark Master and working for Costanza.
He nearly buys into the idea, upsetting the whole plan, but changes his mind at
the last. So, Lord Balzac and Faustus square off in a duel...
</P>
<P>
What a fight! Faustus fights extremely poorly, but wounds Balzac a couple of
times. They seem evenly matched, but Faustus's luck prevails and Hygulf has to
step in and teleport the two of them away, before Balzac finishes Faustus
off!
</P>
<P>
Faustus heals up, and sleeps a while, and then returns to challenge Balzac
again. Lord Balzac *laughs* at him, and accepts the challenge -- saying that
now he can finish the death of a Tyr worshipper that he had started the
previous day. But, this time Faustus has better luck and he gives better than
he takes, finally bringing Balzac to his knees! Faustus enjoys the kill of such
a powerful Baneite... but not for long, because the rest of Lord Balzac's army
starts looking for him.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes run like hell and hide in a haystack until they can teleport back to
Hu&aelig;tburg, the next day.
</P>
<P>
So, this puts us at the beginning of Brewfest, the biggest festival in Wayland.
Next week we will meet Corbert, the mayor of Selenica, and possibly even
Costanza himself. See you then!
</P>
