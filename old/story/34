Richfest 1-4, 1900:
</P>
<P>
With Selenica out of danger, our heroes decided to tackle some of the &quot;favors&quot; they owe people. First up: get the autobook that chronicled Costanza's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Since the book is more-or-less replaceable, but the artifact pen that wrote it isn't, our heroes decided to concentrate on the pen. They invited Bernden to Selenica for another &quot;meeting of the minds&quot; -- Retrospection.
</P>
<P>
That night, they examined the memories of the world to determine the location of the pen. After a number of queries, several of which were answered from what appeared to be Costanza's own memories, Zachery discovered that Costanza had sent the pen back &quot;home&quot; -- to his home region, in the past when he was in charge of all the area around Selenica. The pen had been sent 2000 years into the past!
</P>
<P>
Our heroes discussed the possibility of retrieving the pen. If they time traveled, they suspected that they would get in trouble with the Temporal Council. Even if they did go, no one knew what they would find. The only way to know for sure was to ask permission and advice from the one time traveler they had met before... Zachery contacted Jast and they decided that he would meet them in Selenica the next day.
</P>
<P>
Curious, Skeeve set out to determine where Jast was. Zachery's contact indicated he was almost 300 miles away. Skeeve teleported to C&aelig;lwynn and contacted Jast -- 150 miles. He had to be either in H&aelig;dburg or near the mouth of the Gorgon River. So Skeeve teleported again, to a few miles from our heroes' castle-to-be, and contacted Jast for the third time -- he was in the Gorgon River, in Athmyr.
</P>
<P>
So what would a powerful Chronomancer be doing on the river? Skeeve made a Sight Link with Jast and saw what he saw: Jast was on a riverboat carrying a bunch of barrels down the river to the sea. As Skeeve watched and listened (with Sound Link), he discovered that Jast was acting as the captain of the boat and that they were taking a time-sensitive cargo all the way across the sea to Beogar... His curiosity still unsatisfied, Skeeve had to leave after a couple of hours. He rejoined the others in Selenica and told them what he had seen, but they were as puzzled as he.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Jast arrived. Our heroes told him the situation with the pen and Jast gave them a short lesson in &quot;Temporal Physics&quot;, as he called it. The pen, having existed 2000 years ago in the Great Elven Library, would have been drawn towards its previous self, starting the moment it entered that time. When future things or people visit themselves in the past, they generally merge into the past self, causing a &quot;loop&quot; in time. The object or person then does not exist at all after the future-most point of that loop. Additionally, the object or person doesn't have to touch its prior self -- it just needs to get close. With a powerful and important object such as the pen, it probably would only need to come within 100 miles of its prior self to instantly merge and loop. 
</P>
<P>
Jast suggested that our heroes travel back in time and steal the pen from whoever received it in the past, before it gets close enough to loop with itself. That way everyone would believe that it had looped and there would be much less paradox created by bringing it back to the present. Jast would have offered to help, but he had already been to that time period and didn't want to loop himself! Jast left by the afternoon, after making sure our heroes knew that they owe him a favor...
</P>
<P>
Never ones to go in without knowing all about the situation, our heroes fired up the Retrospection again. They learned the story of the pen as it traveled to the past.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When Costanza heard that the pen and autobook were in his power (no word on how it was stolen from the Library, though), he commanded that only he would have contact with them. The items were teleported to him and he instantly time traveled back 2000 years. In the past, in his own realm, he commanded his lieutenant, Versurdel, to take the items to Baital, a powerful wizardress, to transport them to the Great Elven Library. Versurdel did as he was told. Thus, in Ruander, in the year of the elves 3997, at 2:30 in the afternoon, the pen and book existed for the sum total of three minutes as the wizardress put them in her pouch and teleported to the Library.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
To steal the pen, they'd need to be quick and nearly perfect; there would be no time for a third try at it. So our heroes made their plan and put it into motion.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf wormholed them to the shore of the Rhu'nada Sea, just inside Haranshire. 
(Since time travel doesn't include distance travel, they had to be in the right place before they left.) Then Skeeve attempted to use Time Trip to let them all travel to the past... on the third try, he succeeded! Instantly, Hygulf summoned the pen to them from out of the woman's pouch... and succeeded fantastically! Pen in hand, Skeeve released his hold on the time stream and our heroes found themselves back in the present.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve, Zachery, Hygulf, and the Assassin let out their collective breath. They had just time traveled! The Ruander of the past looked like a beautiful white city surrounded by the azure water, instead of the crumbled ruins overrun by trees that they could see now. Someday, they would have to go back to that city and explore it... For now, though, they wormholed to the Library and returned the pen to Stonne.
</P>
<P>
What will Stonne's reaction be? Will he forgive our heroes? Be here next time for the next errand -- fun with dragons!
</P>
