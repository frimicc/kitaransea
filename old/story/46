<A NAME="Story85">Eighty-fifth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Patchwall 16-18, 1900:
</P>
<P>Our heroes begin their academic administration tasks in earnest. Dorwing arrives on the morning of Patchwall 16th to suggest that Hygulf and Skeeve take on another teacher for their school. The prospective instructor would arrive the next day for an interview. "But he has a couple of issues," Dorwing warned.
</P>
<P>
Ash, the prospective teacher, used to work with Costanza. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's completely reformed now," Dorwing claimed. "He was charmed by Costanza into following him. Now he is sorry for what he did and wants to rejoin the Network. We figured we'd send him down here where you two can be a good influence on him." (Dorwing doesn't know our heroes all that well, does he?) After a bit of grumbling, Hygulf and Skeeve agree to take on the possibly troublesome psionicist.
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Ash teleports into the courtyard, a common occurance these days. Our heroes take him into the tower to interview him... The questions are pointed and direct. They discover the following tidbits:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Ash learned under Master Geoffrey of Wayland.</LI>
<LI>He was indeed charmed into working for Costanza.</LI>
<LI>When Costanza was killed and his forces scattered, Ash contacted his old master to try to explain and get back into the Network. His master referred him to Dorwing, who has arranged for a probation.(!)</LI>
<LI>He seems withdrawn and taciturn, but reasonably sincere.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
So our heroes decide to let him join them, but to keep a watchful eye on him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Skeeve has become more and more interested in the ways of time travel. He contacts Jast to ask him if he can take a class or receive instruction in travelling through time and avoiding paradox. Jast refers him to Stankitosman, a Psionic time traveller and the scheduler for classes in this region. Stankitosman tells Skeeve that there is a class scheduled for the 17th, the next day, to be held at the Library. 
</P>
<P>
So after the interview with Ash, Skeeve wormholes to the Great Library to attend class. The class is taught by a 15-year-old boy, who seems to be unfamiliar with local customs. The boy, called Lybod, took Skeeve to a room containing a tiny clock, about the size of a man and set into a wooden cabinet. Skeeve asked questions about sending messages to himself from the future but Lybod was vague about the practice. Instead, he gave Skeeve a task: stop the clock. Skeeve was confused about the point of the exercise until Lybod gave away the answer: he reached into the cabinet and stopped the clock's pendulum. "The point," he said, "is that you should aim for the simplest solution to a problem. Don't go travelling through time unless you have to." Then he vanished, leaving Skeeve to head back to Earnsige just as confused as before.
</P>
<P>
The next day, our heroes decided that it was time to start working on the Illithid threat. They wormholed to the Granos Mountains, to look for Brimforirlan. The cabin he had been in before was still there on the shores of the lake, but it was occupied by someone else -- a local-seeming Beogaran man. When asked about the ancient elf, he was quiet until our heroes identified themselves. Then he said, "Skeeve? The hero of the Battle of Gothos? Anything for you!" Then he handed them each a potion which he claimed was Water Breathing and said, "You can meet him in there. Just go in along the bottom and you should see the place."
</P>
<P>
So, unusually trusting, our heroes take the potions and walk into the lake... Be here next time when they traverse the underwater world!
