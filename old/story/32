<A NAME="Story71">Seventy-first Meeting</A>

<P>
Wealsun 25-6, 1900:
</P>
<P>
At the doorstep of the Great Elven Library, Zachery saw the spectacle with Costanza's body, Stonne, and Hygulf and Skeeve. The librarian spoke: "You had better go. They will be following you and I will not have them coming here!"
</P>
<P>
So, too drained to wormhole himself, Skeeve contacted Bernden in C&aelig;lwynn, who arranged for a wormhole back the the King's castle. All of our heroes, including Zachery and the Assassin, went through.
</P>
<P>
In Beogar, Bernden congratulated our heroes for getting rid of Costanza and ending his threat to the world. Ecstatic, but wary, Bernden arranged for several Knights of the Mind to watch over our heroes while they rested from their ordeal. Before resting, Skeeve decided he had to contact several people and let them know what had happened.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve contacted the King of Beogar and told him. The King was full of congratulations and offered the resources of the castle in our heroes' defense.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve contacted Donnson, a mage on the Council of Summoners, who was not happy to be interrupted. Skeeve asked what would happen to someone who killed a member of the Council... Donnson did not respond, so Skeeve told him about Costanza and that he and Hygulf had a &quot;partial&quot; Tome of Martek for the Council. Donnson said that he would let the rest of the Council know this information. He still did not seem happy.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve contacted Carl, the Assemblyman of Wayland that Zachery had contacted long ago, who had been permanently dominated by Costanza. (see the <A HREF="22.html#Story60">60th</A> meeting) Carl was completely free of Costanza's influence and thanked Skeeve profusely! He suggested that our heroes <B>must</B> come to Nethathon for a big celebration of the city's being released from Costanza's clutches. Even Bigby will be there...
</P>
<P>
Next, Skeeve tried to contact a member of the Network ruling council who our heroes had identified as not being on Costanza's side, but the psionicist did not want to be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Skeeve contacted Master Brand to tell him about Costanza's death. Master Brand paid our heroes the ultimate compliment by saying, "I am no longer your master. You have all advanced beyond my skills. You should think about taking on an apprentice or two, yourselves!" Of course, he would notify various people within the Network about Costanza, although he figured the important psionicists would already know...
</P>
<P>
During this time, Zachery snuck out of his quarters in the castle. The assassin wondered where he had gone and found him saddling Dhak. "I'm not sticking around here waiting for Costanza's lackeys to come attack," Zachery said. "I'm going to Gothos to ask the Emperor for intervention. Do you want to come with?" The assassin agreed and the two of them winged off into the morning light.
</P>
<P>
Back in the castle, Hygulf and Skeeve had rested enough to function again. Hygulf sat down to go through the stuff they had taken from Costanza. Surprisingly, none of it was magical! Several items seemed to be psionic, though... After some trial and error, he found:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>2 300 PSP receptacles, made out of small gems.</LI>
<LI>a ring of Psionic Inflation (constant), which they gave to Bernden</LI>
<LI>a ring of Tower of Iron Will (constant)</LI>
<LI>a gem (amulet) of Suppress Magic (3x/day)</LI>
<LI>a belt with a Time/Space Anchor (constant)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
A couple of hours later, Hygulf and Skeeve wormholed to Nethathon to see how the people were reacting. A plume of smoke rose from one section of the city and drew our heroes directly to Costanza's house in the city. The house was surrounded by a crowd of people including psionicists and wizards. Bigby was there, throwing fireballs against the wooden building. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a huge wormhole opened up above the crowd and lava started to pour out! If our heroes didn't act fast, all the attackers would be engulfed! So Skeeve opened another wormhole directly under the previous one -- and put the other end above the house. :) Lava poured through and practically disintegrated the house. Unfortunately, the lava continued falling for a full minute and began to wash down the street in all directions. The nearby wooden buildings caught fire and went to cinders instantly. People, attackers and innocents, ran as fast as they could, but many could not escape the fast-flowing liquid rock.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the lava stopped flowing, Skeeve opened another wormhole above the area, but this one dumped water from the nearby sea onto the fires. Another wormhole opened a moment later, with the same function. The falling water was turned instantly to scalding steam and a dense, burning fog filled the narrow streets. Two minutes later, it was all over: the fires were out and the steam began to thin out.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes stepped gingerly on the now-solid rock, which was where a street and houses used to be. The devastation was dramatic -- two entire blocks were covered with the strange rock formations and a dozen buildings were completely obliterated. The better part of valor appealed to Hygulf and Skeeve and they walked out of the rubble to the Assembly building. The militia didn't stop them, but the crowd of onlookers didn't cheer either.
</P>
<P>
At the Assembly building, our heroes introduced themselves to Carl. He immediately announced that they were the "Heroes of the Day" and set a dozen assistants scurrying to make preparations for the coming celebration. Skeeve and Hygulf found themselves put up in a room at the best inn in the city, with hot-and-cold-running-servants and a real dinner. Skeeve contacted Zachery and wormholed him, the assassin, and Dhak to Nethathon to join the celebration. (Since it didn't look like they would be killed immediately.)
</P>
<P>
In the morning a huge parade was held in our heroes honor. Zachery flew on Dhak, an impressive sight. The rest were transported in a luxurious carriage down the main street to a hastily erected stage. On the stage sat Bigby, the Lord High General of Wayland, Carl, and other dignitaries. Each gave a speech in his turn thanking our heroes (the Illuminati) for saving the Assembly, Selenica, and all of Wayland from Costanza's nefarious plans. At the end, Bigby presented each hero with Wayland's highest honor: the Coin of Wayland. A heavy platinum medallion, it also gives the possessor lifetime tax-free status and Wayland citizenship. Bigby also whispered that he would forgive them for not obtaining the Tome of Martek.
</P>
<P>
Congratulations to the Illuminati! With Costanza dead and their Council of Summoners' membership approved, what will they do next? Find out next time!
</P>
