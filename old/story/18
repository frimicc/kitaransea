</H2>
<P>
Readying 4 - Planting 1, 1900:
</P>
<P>
After their time with the Ketite troops, our heroes deserved a little time off.
So they meditated and trained for the next 60 days, staying secluded through all of Readying, Coldeven, and even through the wonderful Growfest. When at last they emerged, it was late spring... and two months had gone by...
</P>
<P>
One of their first actions was to find out what happened with the Network and the Mayor of Selenica, whom our heroes had given into their care. Master Brand contacted his people and discovered that the Network was &quot;still investigating the issue.&quot; Not particularly helpful, nor promising.
</P>
<P>
Next, our heroes went out into Hu&aelig;tburg, to see how the town had held up. They immediately found trouble -- even townsfolk who they had known for some time started to look askance at Zachery. One bartender even asked him to leave, &quot;so as not to cause trouble.&quot; What could cause this change in behaviour? War with Ket!
</P>
<P>
During the past couple of months, instead of stopping the war, the King of Beogar had taken the lead! The Beogaran armies had practically walked right through the Ketite forces (though no one can rightly say how...) and taken over the cities of Alpanas and Stanas, and marched all the way through the countryside to besiege Gothos! And that was all by Coldeven 22! 
</P>
<P>
Our heroes were perplexed. A discussion ensued about what to do now: Hygulf defended the war, saying that it was right for Beogar to attack the (I may not have this exactly right :) ) &quot;evil, baby-eating, murderous Banites.&quot; Zachery took Ket's side and tried to defend their way of life: slaves made life easier for everyone, the enslaved were taught and &quot;brought out of their primitive ways,&quot; gladiatorial games let people blow off steam in a non-destructive way, the emperor was an efficient method of government, etc. Since Zachery grew up in Gothos, he *had* to defend the place... Skeeve sat by the wayside, trying to decide if he wanted to get in-between the other two. Finally, he suggested that they gather some more information about the situation, which was promptly seconded and thirded.
</P>
<P>
Zachery contacted King Hrethrew of Beogar. The King was outside of Gothos with the Beogaran army, but he invited our heroes to come visit. He even pointed out a marked-off section of ground in the army's camp that he said was a &quot;landing pad.&quot; (Hmm...) So, our heroes wormholed to that location. They were met by a young lad who led them through the camp towards the King's tent. On the way, they spotted Bernden, a fellow Knight of the Mind, ... wearing a black armband with an eye of fire on it! 
</P>
<P>
Upon questioning, our heroes discovered that there was a reason Beogar's troops had made such easy work of the Ketite defenders -- the King had made psionics legal in the army, similarly to the way it was done in Wayland! The troops, thinking that the Ketite enemy had been using &quot;mindwitches&quot; for some time already, thought that this was a good idea -- it meant that they could defend themselves against the evil Ket mindwitches. However, Bernden had only been in a couple of mental battles during combat; mostly it had been big area of effect morale-boosting sorts of stuff. Currently, with the army outside Gothos, there were almost 20 Knights of the Mind, all of whom had pledged their lives to the young King.
</P>
<P>
Finally, our heroes reached the King's tent. He told them about his talks with the Generals who had attacked Ket in the first place. The Generals had managed to convince the King that they actually <B>could</B> take large portions of Ket easily. So, they did. The King wanted to go to Gothos for two reasons: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>to damage or destroy the main Temples of Bane in the city, and</LI>
<LI>to find and kill the Dark Master.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Our heroes all heartily agreed with the second goal, and decided that they could help attain it. Hygulf? Zachery? came up with the idea of holding the city of Gothos hostage -- when the Emperor turned over the Dark Master, who our heroes believe is presiding over the city as Grand Vizier Erdun, the Beogaran army would leave the city intact. However, Zachery could not contact the Emperor at all. Next, he tried contacting some spirits who might know where the Emperor was staying (since he had teleported out of Gothos a week earlier). The spirits were not completely helpful, and ended up sidetracking Zachery into asking lots of questions about Faustus's whereabouts instead. *grin* 
</P>
<P>
So, what will happen next week? Will they talk with the Emperor of Ket, arguably the most powerful political force on the continent? Will they sack the Temple of Bane, just outside the walls of Gothos? We'll find out!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="Story50">Fiftieth Meeting!</A>
</H2>
<P>
Planting 2 - 3, 1900:
</P>
<P>
While Zachery meditated to regain enough power to try to track down the Emperor of Ket again, Hygulf took a different approach. He teleported to the Great Elven Library, to ask
them to look in the Emperor's automatically-written book. A couple of hours later, Hygulf had the answer: the Emperor is staying in a castle several miles west of Telos. (with directions on how to get there!)
</P>
<P>
Hygulf returned to the Beogaran army camp outside of Gothos. Our heroes decided that the best way to use this information was to use clairvoyance on the castle to find an appropriate teleport landing spot. Zachery used his Clairvoyance to see directly into the castle, and then outside to find a suitable spot.
</P>
<P>
So, were our heroes ready to go? Not yet! First, they decided to check to see if the Grand Vizier Erdun (of Ket) was <I>really</I> the Dark Master. So, Zachery tried to contact the Grand Vizier using an image from someone in the camp who had seen him. The contact was rebuffed -- by a 15th level + Psionicist! (Yup, that must be him, alright.:) ) Zachery also recognized the &quot;mental signature&quot; of the Dark Master, from a previous experience.
</P>
<P>
With that out of the way, Zahcery used Precognition to see how successful their mission to the Emperor would be. The plan was to have the King of Beogar write a letter, which said that if the Emperor delivered the Grand Vizier to the Beogaran army, they would leave the city of Gothos intact and immediately leave Ket lands. The King wrote the letter and gave his reasons for wanting the Grand Vizier: that he had ordered his father killed.
</P>
<P>
Well, the precognition showed that the Emperor would probably not be impressed with the action of personal vengeance starting a major war. So, our heroes had the King re-write the letter, to show how the Grand Vizier, by authorizing such an international action, was usurping the Emperor's personal power. With the new letter, our heroes teleported to Telos.
</P>
<P>
Since Zachery was Ketite, he did most of the talking on the trip. Skeeve turned on his Cognative Trance, and &quot;recorded&quot; the entire episode for later review. Our heroes were let in to see the Emperor and his closest advisors. They passed on the letter and were taken outside the room while the assembled personages discussed the matter. While they were waiting, they noticed a couple of interesting books in the waiting room, including one about the life of Costanza! 
</P>
<P>
After Skeeve memorized the book (you *have to* love Cognative Trance!), our heroes were led back into the Emperor's presence. He talked with Zachery personally (!) about Zachery's duty to Ket and whether or not he was violating it by working with the Beogaran King. Also mentioned was that Zachery's father, Lucius Metellus Dasus, is now an advisor to the Emperor... and living in Gothos. The Emperor made no <I>explicit</I> threats, but...
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Emperor stated that &quot;something will happen within two days.&quot; He mentioned the &quot;landing pad&quot; at the Beogaran camp as a place to watch...
</P>
<P>
When our heroes returned to the Beogaran camp, Skeeve filled in the King, Zachery rested and pondered on his new family information, and Hygulf wandered off to find out when the troops were going to attack the Temple of Bane just outside the city. Bernden, one of the original Knights of the Mind, will be planning the attack. Mostly it was all set, except that Bigby (yes, the one who so disliked Hygulf before...) was going to come and help.
</P>
<P>
We ended with Bigby's dramatic entrance into camp. What will happen next? Will the Dark Master show up hog-tied on the landing pad? Will the Emperor do anything overt? Will the Ketite troops rushing to the scene arrive early? Will the Beogaran forces be able to take the Temple? See you next week!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="Story51">Fifty-first Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Planting 4, 1900:
</P>
<P>
After much planning and preparation, our heroes finally came up with a plan that would tell them if it was safe to help in the attack on the Banite Temple. Sometime during the next week, Skeeve will write a letter stating whether or not the Dark Master was delivered to the camp, exactly when, and in what condition. Then he will time-travel back to now and put the letter in a chest in the King's tent. That way Hygulf and Skeeve will know when to expect the Dark Master...
</P>
<P>
So, when they opened the chest, it contained a letter, penned hastily by Skeeve, which said that the Dark Master arrives on the landing pad, bound and gagged, at the same time the Ketite army arrives. This will be followed by a short battle. Armed with this information, Hygulf and Skeeve feel free to tire themselves at the battle of the Temple.
</P>
<P>
Leaving Zachery to watch for the Dark Master, Hygulf and Skeeve convince their way into the strike force. Skeeve has a great idea for <I>major</I> damage, and Hygulf is to be kept in reserve, to use his great combat skill where it is most needed. As the preparations in the camp reach a feverish pitch, the priests of Tyr say blessings over the 300 or so troops who have been chosen for this important mission. Finally, all is ready.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve phases himself and then teleports to a point a mile above the Temple of Bane. Then he opens a wormhole from here to the bottom of a giant pool of lava in the underdark! For four whole minutes he holds open the doorway, through which pours a million cubic feet of molten rock! It smashes into the temple, burning and destroying everything in its path. After a minute or two, lava begins to fill the temple from the inside, pushing troops and priests to their deaths out through windows, doors, walls... In the fourth minute, Skeeve receives a contact, which is his signal to teleport back to camp and close the wormhole. 
</P>
<P>
The temple has been destroyed! Everyone congratulates Skeeve, who almost single-handedly wiped the edifice from the face of the earth. But, not everyone was killed in the lava. Some troops working their way around the side of the temple report that a demon is rampaging through their midst! Hygulf is teleported to the spot. The demon seems to look familiar...
</P>
<P>
First, he wrenches the demon to this plane of existence. Then he attackes it. The demon, though, acts very strangely. Upon seeing Hygulf, it says, &quot;Oh no!&quot; Then, as it is being attacked, it asks him in its hideous voice, if the troops are his companions. Finally, it vanishes, before Hygulf can strike the killing stroke. With the demon gone, Hygulf turns to its controllers: he mows through four of five Banite priests before any of them have a chance to react. Only one priest survives, because he instantly runs around a corner shouting something like &quot;demon slayer.&quot; As Hygulf gives chase, he comes up against a young man wearing no armor and carrying no weapons.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf attacks immediately, but his blows seem to have no effect. Even his dimension blade cannot seem to cut through the man's skin. Finally, the man gets a chance to attack -- and Hygulf feels the full weight of his own damage come back at him! Instantly Hygulf recognizes his foe as a <I>sensei</I>, one of the most dangerous kinds of psionic fighters. The sensei has used Kinetic Control to contain all of Hygulf's power and turn it back on him. Iron Will kicks in for Hygulf, as he feels consciousness leaving him. Hygulf has just enough power to teleport back to camp, where his wounds are tended. He thinks he saw the sensei smile as he left...
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, the battle is over. The Beogaran troops have won! The temple is destroyed and its denizens dispersed. Now the faithful of Tyr have only a day to wait, before the Ketite troops arrive...
</P>
<P>
Be here next time for the Dark Master! The escape! The wrath of Zachery! (And we may find out how many young fighters want to apprentice to &quot;The Hero of Tyr&quot;, Hygulf.)
</P>
