<P>
Brewfest 1-2, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes spent some time planning their course of action, and then teleported
to the site of Costanza's tomb to begin their infiltration of Selenica.
</P>
<P>
The night they all *finally* arrived, a young man came up looking like he had
been wandering lost for days. He explained that he was Gregory of Nethathon, a
new adventuring thief. He had been in an underground castle, but walked through
a door and ended up here. His mind was easily read by Zachery, who determined
that he was telling what he thought was the truth...
</P>
<P>
Our heroes decided to let him join them until they reached Selenica, the next
day.
</P>
<P>
The next day, it had stopped raining, and they finished the hike to Selenica,
going into a tavern near the edge of the city for refreshment... and we
ended.
</P>
<P>
What awaits them in Selenica? We'll find out next time!!

<P>
Brewfest 3-5, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Well, it all happened these few days -- everything that our heroes had expected
to happen... sort-of.
</P>
Our heroes started in the first tavern they could find in Selenica. While they
ate, Zachery spent the time playing with Faustus's mind, Hygulf ate, and
Grimden spoke with the innkeeper. They collectively discovered that:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Selenica has "research companies", who specialize in treasure-hunting in the
ruins of the old cities in the area. Adventurers usually join a company, and
then have certain benefits and rights in the eyes of the law. 
</LI>
<LI>
The 3 Diamonds Research Company was interested in hiring our heroes, but they
never followed up (for good reason!)
</LI>
<LI>
There is very little crime in Selenica, ever since a short while ago...
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
That night, Hygulf and Zachery decided that they would let the demon loose to
try to steal Costanza's amulet of proof against detection and location. In the
morning, there is much ado about who is going to church for Godsday services --
Faustus wins and Zachery is dragged along, but Hygulf is nowhere to be found.
Zachery succeeds in making himself a *huge* pain to Faustus and Grimden, thus
getting revenge.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hygulf teleported to visit the demon. A loooong session of haggling
ended with the demon agreeing to (1) get Costanza's amulet, (2) not "harm"
anyone in the process, (3) never interfere or harm our heroes, and (4) bring
the amulet back to Hygulf. The demon agreed to this under threat of being
forced to worship Tyr forever after, if he failed at his tasks! So, the demon
vanished in a puff of smoke.
</P>
<P>
As the others left the church, they heard screaming from the Mayor of
Selenica's house, on the town square. When they arrived, they saw several dead
guards in the doorway and heard more screaming from inside. Faustus ran in with
his sword drawn, but Zachery decided to wait for the City Watch. Inside,
Faustus found more dead guards. He was nearly arrested by the Watch, when they
arrived, but they sorted that out. The Watch trooped slowly up the stairs, with
Faustus in the lead...
</P>
<P>
At the top of the steps, Faustus saw a HORRIBLE DEMON looming over Costanza,
holding an amulet. The demon SMILED AT FAUSTUS and then vanished. As Faustus
quickly recovered, he noticed that Costanza was sitting on the floor, wounded,
defenseless... He swung, but missed! The Watch grabbed at him, but he
teleported away to Hu&aelig;tburg rather than be captured. He will remember the
look of that demon the rest of his life...
</P>
<P>
Outside, Zachery contacted Hygulf and explained what had happened. Realizing
that the two of them had unleashed this carnage, Zachery bought the first horse
he could find and skipped town. Hygulf would meet Zachery at Costanza's Tomb
later. Grimden stayed in town, but tried to be as inconspicuous as possible. He
was going to continue the mission, whether the others would or not!
</P>
<P>
Hygulf waited and met the demon, who politely handed over the amulet and
vanished. Then Hygulf vanished, to meet Zachery and try to determine the extent
of the damage they had caused...

<A NAME="RTFToC34">Thirty-Second Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Patchwall 1-7, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes spent this week in separate groups. Faustus spent the week in prayer
and meditation. Grimden pursued his interests in Selenica. Hygulf and Zachery
had another adventure.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf turned into an eagle and flew Zachery north in Wayland to the town of
Milborne. It's a small place, with a river, two inns, two important families
and a few buildings. Hygulf dropped Zachery off to fend for himself, while he
teleported to the Great Elven Library. (Zachery did pretty well, considering
that he doesn't speak two words of Waylander!)
</P>
<P>
In the Library, Hygulf discovered that the elves were closely watching and
guarding the automatic book that had started following Costanza with the
phrase, "The demon removed the amulet and knocked Costanza against the wall..."
The book was off limits to him, but the Librarian offered to send him weekly
updates. The *real* problem was that the Council of Summoners was mad about the
release of the demon. 
</P>
<P>
The Council consists of several high-level mages and psionicists who oversee
all traffic with other planes of existence. The demon was released without
consulting them, so they are now determined to hunt down and remove the powers
of (i.e., kill) the person who performed the act. Luckily, they don't know that
it was Hygulf... yet. At least one of the Council of Summoners was
Mordenkainen, who lives in Selenica. He was present when Costanza's Tomb was
opened, and thought dead... maybe he has been dominated? *evil laugh*
</P>
<P>
With that unpleasant news, Hygulf returned to Milborne to meet Zachery. They
decided that their best bet to stay alive and out of the mages'/autarch's
collective way was to pretend to be just normal adventurers. So, they looked
around town and found out that Jelenneth, the daughter of Haledar Carman (the
owner of the town, pretty much) had been kidnapped. Jelenneth was a young mage,
who studied under the mage Tauster in Thurmaster (the village down the road).
Zachery contacted Jelenneth and found out that she was being kept in a sack and
carried down a long tunnel underground. The people or things carrying her did
not need light to see, and traveled very surely down twisty passages. 
</P>
<P>
Our heroes decided to go to Thurmaster and talk to the master wizard. They flew
there, and saw ruins in the large forest just south of Milborne. When they
asked about the ruins later, no one seemed to know that they were there.
Tauster was no help, but suggested that our heroes find Jelenneth soon. Hygulf
and Zachery flew back to Milborne, and rested for the night.
