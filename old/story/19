<P>
Planting 5-8, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes started by resting up after the Battle of the Temple, last time. As each character finished meditating, a grand discussion about power and its escalation arose. Zachery was worried that there would be no end in sight, if the <I>Knights of the Mind</I> continued to act openly. For witness, he called attention to the various substances raining on Beogaran troops surrounding Gothos, which were obviously sparked by Skeeve's great idea at the battle. Skeeve was on the side of &quot;the more open the better.&quot; Hygulf tried to argue that it was not an &quot;arms race,&quot; but even he didn't believe that fully. In the end, Zachery decided that he had to leave the <I>Knights of the Mind</I>, because it seemed to be poised to become an arm of the Church of Tyr.
</P>
<P>
Zachery told King Hrethrew his decision and the king took it well. Then Zachery mentioned that Skeeve had received a note from himself... The king was upset that he hadn't been informed about this! Knowing in advance that the Dark Master would be delivered at the same time as the Ketite troops arrived drastically changed the king's battle plans. He thanked Zachery for the information and continued planning for the troops' withdrawal from Gothos.
</P>
<P>
Next, while Zachery snuck off into Gothos to deliver a message to his father, Metellus Dasus, Hygulf and Skeeve had a chat with Bernden, the current leader of the <I>Knights of the Mind</I> about the exit strategy and what to do about the Dark Master. This was of the utmost importance, because it was only a few more hours until dawn...
</P>
<P>
In the morning, a page came up to our heroes and told them that a group of strange men had &quot;appeared&quot; around the landing pad at dawn. Everyone hurried to look. They saw that ten men, dressed identically in black leather armor and shaven heads. The men looked eerily similar to one another. Hygulf talked to one, who claimed that they were an enforcer group from the Network. The enforcers were here to take instant custody of the Dark Master, should he arrive. The lead enforcer mentioned, as proof of his claim, the note that Skeeve had sent himself about the Dark Master. Our heroes shrugged and backed off to watch.
</P>
<P>
It was a cold, cloudy day for Planting (May). An hour before dawn, most of the Beogaran troops were sent through enormous wormholes on the first leg of their long journey home. A couple hours of tense waiting later, a man suddenly appeared on the ground about 20 yards from the landing pad. A quick glance told our heroes that it was the Dark Master! And he seemed unconscious... The enforcers grabbed him quickly and teleported out. It was over as quickly as it had begun.
</P>
<P>
As the Ketite troops came over the hill, our heroes wormholed out the last of the Beogaran troops and themselves.
</P>
<P>
A couple of wormholes later, the next day, all of the Beogaran troops were safely in Alpanas, which was still under Beogaran control. Great rejoicing! Parties last throughout the day and night. And, at all of them, Skeeve's name is shouted out as the hero of the battle! Skeeve, the chosen one of Tyr! Skeeve, destroyer of Banites! etc. After a couple of hours of this, even Skeeve started to get antsy. About then he realized that the Banites weren't going to sit still for very long... they would get revenge against the person who leveled their temple...
</P>
<P>
While at an early morning gathering, our heroes are surprised to see the head enforcer walk into the room. He comes directly to their table and delivers the worst news of the day: it wasn't the Dark Master. It was just some kid who had been polymorphed to look like the Dark Master. Since he had been unconscious, no one noticed until it was too late. The enforcer immediately teleported out. Our heroes ran to tell the king the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
The king didn't take this news nearly as well. He was so angry he shouted, ranted and jumped around for over a minute! In the aftermath, our heroes decided that the best thing to do was to get away from it all and go home to Hu&aelig;tburg. Once there, they slept for the first good night they had had in a while.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, more things came to light. Sigmund wanted to see Skeeve. They met, and Skeeve asked for whatever protection the church could give him. The Baron wanted to see Skeeve. Skeeve sang the new song he had written for the baron; the song glorifies Tyr's part in the battle, but makes no mention of Skeeve himself. Maybe if the song catches on, people will begin to forget about Skeeve? *evil laughter*
</P>
<P>
After seeing everyone in Hu&aelig;tburg, our heroes go to C&aelig;lwynn. There they talk to Eadbad, the royal priest. Eadbad suggests that if Skeeve becomes one of the faithful of Tyr, Tyr will protect him. Giving up on that idea, Skeeve decided to contact the assassin and ask her to help him. How will that go? We'll find out next time!
</P>

<A NAME="Story53">Fifty-third Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Planting 8-10, 1900:
</P>
<P>
That evening, our heroes met the assassin in the Blue Lantern Tavern, in C&aelig;lwynn. She came in the guise of a young noblewoman, thin, petite, dressed in expensive cloth and a very dark cloak. She looked younger than Hygulf had seen her before, maybe only 16 or so. She agrees to find out information for Skeeve, based on the 100gp &quot;down payment&quot; he gave her. After she left, a couple of Beogaran &quot;toughs&quot; decided to complain about the Ketite in their midst. Zachery, tired of being insulted, dominated the leader of the two and made him start saying good things about Ketites. His companion, who was more drunk, started fighting with him. Zachery didn't let down the domination until both were outside the tavern.
</P>
<P>
Next, our heroes decided to check on the captured Nethoc, former commander of the Ketite army. She was still in the dungeon under the castle, but she was trying to dig her way out. Hygulf notified the dungeon keeper to have her moved to a new cell in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Master Brand contacted Skeeve and told him that someone from the Temporal Council would contact Skeeve soon, to talk about his habit of sending notes to himself from the future. Skeeve was looking for advice about whether to send himself the exact same note he had received, or if he should add a bit about &quot;don't get mixed up in the attack on the Temple.&quot; In the meantime, our heroes started examining a certain <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT>. 
</P>
<P>
During breakfast, our heroes met the new Royal Mage of Beogar, an old man named Leofson. He is a Diviner, since any more powerful magic would have been vetoed by the King. However, he seems to know quite a lot about many things. He even agrees to look into finding an Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location for Skeeve.
</P>
<P>
Later, our heroes wormholed to Alhwick, to get close enough to the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> to be able to use clairvoyant powers on him. On the first try, Zachery gets a good look at a completely black cavern. Then, with True Seeing, he sees that the dragon is there, has an ethereal presence, and is very big. Aura Sight shows that the <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> is completely Chaotic and Evil, and much bigger than our heroes -- around 20th level! As that sank in, a passing farmer stopped by where our heroes are standing in a field and came towards them.
</P>
<P>
After an initial bit of fun, the farmer identified himself as Jast, a member of the Temporal Council, and a Chronomancer. He told Skeeve about classes in Time Travel that are taught at the Elven Library, during every festival. He also tried to explain why Skeeve had to send back the same note that he received. Before, the TC had tried to change the past in a number of ways. They even went and killed the great time-travelling Autarch when he was a baby. Autarch Coralinth, that is. So instead, they got Costanza who did the same thing two years later. &quot;Changing the past almost never works the way you think it will.&quot; Jast left as our heroes travelled back to C&aelig;lwynn to see what Leofson knew about dragons...
</P>
<P>
Leofson mentions their ability to generate fear, their ability to cast spells with only a thought, and that they cannot be surprised. Disheartened, our heroes perk up at the mention of Ollogar, a dwarven armorer, who could make armor out of <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Red Dragon</FONT> hide. So, will they attack the dragon? Will the Banites attack them? Will the assassin be helpful? We'll find out next time!
</P>
