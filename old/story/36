Reaping 2 - 3, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Finally! The long-awaited assault on Castle Earnsige... almost.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes jumped into action: planning, of course. First, to deliver an ultimatium to the current occupants. Our heroes teleported to the hill just above the castle, to get a better view.
</P>
<P>
Zachery used his clairvoyance to find a stupid-looking guard, standing watch on the top of the keep. Once Zachery contacted him, though, he turned out to be well-trained; he not only attempted to thwart Zachery's contact, he then shouted to his mates that he had been "breached", warning them to be wary of his actions. Zachery had to use False Sensory Input to make him think that he was hearing his boss's voice to get him to enter the tower.
</P>
<P>
Inside the tower, the guard ran into the boss and relayed Zachery's question: What would it take to make you vacate the premises? The leader of the brigands, Lillangwel, said he would think about it, but would need a day or two. Zachery said that he would contact the same guard in two days for an answer.
</P>
<P>
As Zachery and Skeeve set up camp, Zachery was contacted by someone close by who would not identify himself. Zachery let him into his mind (!) and they talked for a bit. The person suggested that our heroes should be careful of the town when they attacked the castle. There were many good-hearted, hard-working folk there who had nothing whatsoever to do with the current castle inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hygulf got fed up with the waiting around and teleported himself and the assassin to Hu&aelig;tburg to find Shalinar, his long-lost pet panther. It was cold and raining in Hu&aelig;tburg. They wandered past the giant rock that still sat where Hygulf's old shop had been and noticed that many of his former neighbors had decided to set up shop on top of the rock! Steps had been carved into the side, for easy access to the top. Surprisingly, no one had moved his shop up there...
</P>
<P>
Since there was no sign of the panther, they went to the castle to see Baron Blackhawk. The Baron was happy to see them and told them that Shalinar had been killing sheep on the outskirts of the area. Anything Hygulf could do to calm him down would be appreciated. He also told them that the cat had been last seen hanging around the dragon stable, to the East. Hygulf and the assassin thanked him and took some supplies for camping. Then they headed East, to track the cat.
</P>
<P>
Night fell. Back at Earnsige, Skeeve was on watch when he saw a Roc fly past Luna, the large moon. Intriuged, he became astral and followed it. It flew East for a ways and then landed at its nest in the high mountains, dropping the sheep it carried for its two chicks. Skeeve was curious as to the Roc's food source -- we wouldn't want it stealing from our heroes' future lands -- and followed it as it left the nest for more. 
</P>
<P>
About ten miles to the West of Castle Earnsige, Skeeve passed over another castle! This one was surrounded by a ring of fires, obviously under siege. Skeeve ditched the Roc and examined his future neighbors, instead. Floating through the castle, Skeeve decided that it was ruled by a middle-aged man and woman, with two page-age children. They were all asleep, right now, of course. Within the walls was a small temple to Lathander; always a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
Having checked out the castle, Skeeve moved to the fires encircling it. The fires were tended by the defenders! They provided light for some ways, illuminating a no man's land where all the brush and grass had been cut away. The troops on defense waited alertly on their side of the lit battleground, but the other side was empty. Skeeve moved past the no man's land and into the surrounding forest before he found the enemy: orcs. A thousand or more of them, camped under the trees and preparing for battle. They had siege engines -- small catapults -- and seemed to be led by a huge orc chieftan. The chief was having a war council with his advisors when Skeeve spotted a map of the area showing the extensive tunnels the orcs had dug to breach the castle walls. 
</P>
<P>
Skeeve returned to his body for a quick conference with Zachery about this information.
</P>
<P>
Back in Hu&aelig;tburg, Hygulf and the assassin had a great time flirting with each other while they set up camp. Finally, the assassin convinced Hygulf that they were not going to share a bedroll tonight, so he wandered off to look for the nocturnal Shalinar. To make his way easier, Hygulf turned into a panther himself... unfortunately, he made a miscalculation and the change was permanent! (not again!) Taking advantage of the situation anyway, he tracked down his pet. Shalinar recognized him, even in panther form, and was happy to see him. When they went back to the camp, Hygulf changed (temporarily) back to his human form to tell the assassin about his predicament. She wasn't as understanding as he had hoped, but she didn't toss him out of camp immediately. They settled down for a peaceful, if separate, night.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Zachery and Skeeve decided to see what the town of Earnsige (as opposed to the castle) thought about their rulers. They telported to the outskirts of the fields and engaged a shepard in conversation. The shepard, Edhathuwel, explained that everyone in town loved the current lord. He and his men recently saved the town from a huge army of orcs who were threatening all their livelihoods. It has been a season since the orcs went away, but the townsfolk aren't heavily taxed and are relatively happy. 
</P>
<P>
The orc comment settled Skeeve's mind that they had to go talk to the neighbors. Skeeve and Zachery teleported to the other castle, outside the protective ring of fires. There they engaged several defenders in conversation, but none of them really believed that our heroes were there to help. The captain did tell some of the story of the siege, though: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The orcs had been menacing a castle to the East several miles, Castle Earnsige. Several adventurers had come to this castle, Castle Coensige, with big plans to get rid of the orcs. All they needed was an army... So Coensige sent their troops to help Earnsige and drove the orcs away from there. Unfortunately, the adventurers had cut a deal with the orcs and the orcs turned from their original target towards Castle Coensige! For a full season, the castle and town had been beset by orcs. Of course, their pleas for help from Earnsige went unheard...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Despite the story, our heroes were getting nowhere, so they teleported directly into the castle, into the hallway in front of the lord's room! Befitting a castle under siege, the response was nearly instant; Skeeve and Zachery were surrounded by guards bearing pikes and swords. Skeeve asked to speak to the lord of the castle, but the guards would not listen. Finally, one of the guards tried to take Skeeve's sword... and Glordoranel spoke to him! Spooked, the guards called the castle priest, Paroc,  who detected no lies from Skeeve and Zachery and decided they could see the lord.
</P>
<P>
Paroc led them down through the keep to the war room, where Lord Eadbalth waited. The lord was a reasonable man. He spoke bluntly to our heroes: the castle could not stand another month of this siege. If "the Illuminati" could help save his people from the orcs, he would be delighted to help roust out his neighbors in Castle Earnsige. Skeeve and Zachery decided that what they really needed were some orc-hunting dwarves. After taking their leave of Lord Eadbalth, they teleported to Kar-Agun, the dwarven homeland in the Granos Mountains.
</P>
<P>
In between, outside Hu&aelig;tburg, Hygulf, Shalinar, and the assassin decided to change their scenery a bit. To give Hygulf time to get back into his normal shape, they teleported to the crater that was their home in the Granos Mountains. The assassin looked around, pronounced it "rustic", and decided to look around in the nearby tunnels to the Underdark. Hygulf spent some time trying to get back to his usual self, but it would take more time than that...
</P>
<P>
Will the dwarves accept Skeeve and Zachery's challenge? Will they make an offer they can't refuse? Be here next time, when we see how many times Hygulf can roll badly!
</P>
