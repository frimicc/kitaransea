Flocktime 24 - 25, 1900:
</P>
<P>
First up this week: a history of the far South. Several thousand years ago
psionicists took over the South, similarly to the time of the Autarchs in the
Kitaran Sea area. However, in the South, the "Autarchs" won. As the great and
powerful psionicists consolidated their power, they soon grew to realize that
ruling an empire wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Additionally, they
discovered that it was much easier to give the people some of what they wanted
instead of trying to rule thousands of people through fear. Thus was born the
great empire, where the psionicist/emperors ruled completely... and
benevolently. (most of the time) 
</P>
<P>
Faustus has spent the past several months in the remote Monastery of El-Akbar, at the
northern border of the South. He learned much about Southron culture and
religion, which is monotheistic. Luckily for his soul, the Southern deity, who
has no name, bears a remarkable resemblence to Tyr. The Southrons don't like
mind control or slavery, but believe that if the ends are benevolent, they
sometimes justify the means...
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, our heroes decided to travel to the South to recruit some
help in their fight against Costanza. However, their plans were immediately
changed when Faustus received his daily morning contact attempt from Costanza
-- he was only 200 miles away! That put his location somewhere around Alhwick.
Shortly thereafter, Faustus received an unknown contact... and accepted it!
After a few moments in his mind, the contact ended and bad things started
happening.
</P>
<P>
First, Faustus and Geronmen went to met Hygulf. They were set upon by two
psionicists who attacked telepathically. Our heroes won the short battle and
one of the attackers surrendered. The Baron's guards came and took his
unconscious form to the dungeon, but he teleported away a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, another contact found Faustus, but from less than a mile
away, as he met with Hygulf in Hygulf's shop to decide what to do next. Our
heroes heard a tremendous whistling sound and decided to teleport to
C&aelig;lwynn to speak with the King. Skeeve, who joined them there, contacted
the Baron in Hu&aelig;tburg and discovered that a giant rock, the size of
several buildings, had been dropped on Hygulf's shop. Unless the ground gave
out and the shop fell into the Thieves' Guild tunnels underneath, it looked
like Hygulf would need to buy new wares.
</P>
<P>
The King suggested that Faustus, Geronmen, and Hygulf proceed with their plan
to travel south. Maybe the distance would throw their pursuers off the scent.
Skeeve decided to stay in C&aelig;lwynn to make sure the King was safe. He
opened a wormhole to the monastery and the others went through.
</P>
<P>
A moment of calm came for our heroes. They politely asked to speak with the
monks' leader and met him at the afternoon meal. Geronmen found the entire
process a bit disconcerting, especially since he could neither speak the
Southron language nor communicate telepathically. Master Abdul, the head of the
place, pledged his support to our heroes, once they told him about Costanza's
activities. Abdul was not bothered so much by the permenent dominations, but
was visibly upset at the use of wormhole to drop large rocks on targets.
"Dropping mountains out of the sky has been banned since nearly the beginning
of warfare, as it is so violent and destructive to innocents that no one would
tolerate it. Anyone who uses such methods deserves to be destroyed." Hygulf
made it a point to mention to Skeeve that he not travel to the South.
</P>
<P>
So, the monks gathered in the courtyard and sent a message to Costanza. Thirty
of them contacted him, one after another, until he finally let one in. He was
told to leave off his dreadful attacks, or they would be met with greater
force. The proof of this was the fact that there were 30 psionicists available
to contact him... Costanza agreed to stop his attacks for now.
</P>
<P>
That night, our heroes were walking along the wall of the quiet monastery when
Hygulf noticed a campfire on the sands outside. They took a young monk named
Maldar with to investigate. At the tent, they saw three men (one with a bastard
sword) and a woman preparing for dinner. They were all northerners, probably
from Wayland or Athmyr. Suddenly, the door of the tent swung open and the
assassin stepped out!
</P>
<P>
She cried, "Oh no! Our deal is off!" and ducked back inside. Well, at the sight
of the known assassin, Faustus detected evil on the group -- yep. He and
Geronmen rushed to attack. Hygulf prepared for a monent and then joined them.
During the fight, the assassin did not stir from the tent, despite the others
calling for her to "fulfill her contract." 
</P>
<P>
Faustus swung away at the leader, who Hygulf recognized (finally!) as the
"Demon Slayer" who was defending the great Temple of Bane when the Beogaran
army attacked it. Hygulf told Faustus to back off, because he wasn't going to
be able to hurt the psionicist. Faustus, confused because his blows seemed to
bounce off of this opponent, did and Hygulf came in and killed him. (The trick?
An Alternate Reality where Hygulf disbelieved in all telekinesis.) 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the woman was killed and the third psionicist teleported away.
The fighter who was left surrendered to Faustus. As Faustus was occupied,
Hygulf slipped into the tent and teleported the assassin out of there. She said
she had been hired to kill "some palidin" for a *lot* of money and would share
it with Hygulf if he saved her from Faustus's wrath.
</P>
<P>
Faustus was full of wrath when he realized what had happened. He contacted the
assassin and talked to her, but wouldn't listen when she said she hadn't known
he specifically was the target. Then Faustus simply stared at Hygulf until they
all went back inside for some rest. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Faustus and Geronmen went to Hygulf. "Hygulf, we have come to
save your soul." They proposed a series of exercises and prayers for Hygulf to
do and say until his mind was clear of the evil woman's taint and he saw the
way to Tyr. Hygulf tried to be polite, but failed. The religious argument ended
in stalemate. Faustus and Geronmen decided to continue recruiting help, both
personnel and materiel, in the South while Hygulf returned to C&aelig;lwynn.
</P>
<P>
Next time: Costanza is down, but not defeated. Why was a Banite (and suspected
follower of the Dark Master) working for Costanza? How much does the assassin
owe Hygulf? And what is next for our heroes...
</P>
