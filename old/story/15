Needfest, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes started out at the Elven Library. The King of Beogar admitted
that he knew nothing about the githyanki who had been observing the coronation
festivities, but was happy to hear that it was on his side. (supposedly, at
least...)
</P>
<P>
Hygulf took some time to question Stonne, the Librarian, about other
countries "beyond the edge of the map." Stonne was less than forthcoming
on this, saying that there was nothing beyond the known area, except for
scrub brush and desert. He seemed to be intentionally skirting the issue.
</P>
<P>
After Hygulf's lesson in celestial dynamics, he and the King went back
to Caelwynn. Skeeve and the thief/assassin, Grenfor, went to Huaetburg instead.
Skeeve
talked with Master Brand about "protective custody" for the thief and
Master Brand received contact information. When Skeeve went back to the
church, where he had left the thief, Grenfor was reeling in shock from having
been contacted by Costanza and threatened. Skeeve and he went to meet the
contact from the Network, who made Grenfor fall asleep and then took him
somewhere safe to be debriefed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hygulf went through the notes that the elves took from their
debriefing of Grenfor:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Only about 4 people working for Costanza can dominate others.
</LI>
<LI>
There are about 30 psionicists total on Costanza's side.
</LI>
<LI>
Currently, Costanza is working to convert the Nomads to his side.
</LI>
<LI>
The list that Skeeve stole contains the name of the Overking of Athmyr!!
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Later, Skeeve rejoined Hygulf and the King in Caelwynn.
</P>
<P>
Needfest 7, 1900:
</P>
<P>
The next day, Skeeve took the King's priest, Eadbad, on a tour of Skullport.
They travelled astrally and the priest's eyes were opened...
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hygulf travelled to the far South. He teleported to the
edge of the desert and then metamorphosized into an Eagle to fly high and
see if he could spot anything of the mythical monastery of Metapsionics.
</P>
<P>
After some trouble, including becoming an eagle permanently(!), he found it!
</P>
<P>
The Monastery of El-Akbar faces east, but has no roads leading up to it. It
sits all alone in the desert, manned by many psionicists of all kinds. They
speak a different language, but can communicate through telepathy with people
like Hygulf. They get all their supplies by teleporting them into a small
room in the gatehouse of the compound. The person who was Hygulf's tourguide
was called "Shiraz" -- he spoke of many things, including the great city of
Basrah to the east and the people of Thrace to the south-west.
</P>
<P>
The next day, Hygulf returned to Caelwynn and spent 3 days turning back into
himself. :)
</P>
<P>
Be here next time to find out more about the monastery! Why did the librarian
not tell them that he had visited the monastery often? Is the King still in
danger? We'll find out.

</H2>
<P>
Fireseek 1-2, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Well, our heroes this week decided to spend two whole hours figuring out if
they could kill a very old Red Dragon! (Of course the decision was 
&quot;not yet&quot;...)
</P>
<P>
After that, they went back to the Great Elven Library, to ask the Librarian why
he had lied to them about the lands to the south. 
</P>
<P>
The Librarian explained that he had done it for our heroes' own good. In the past,
the lands around the Kitaran Sea had relations with the people to the south and east.
However, after the Autarchs, a certain tension grew between the locals, who were
extremely negative about psionics, and the southerners, who were bullish on them.
This led to some minor wars and not a few lynchings. So, about a thousand years ago,
the people with power decided to hide each region from the other. And, after a 
couple of generations died out, the lands to the south and east were thought to be
mysteriously empty by almost everybody. The Librarian does not want to see that kind
of hatred again. Even as recently as 100 years ago, a traveller from the south
found his way into Athmyr... he was lynched within two days.
</P>
<P>
Of course, all the books about the southern regions are secured. Only exceptional
members of the Library can read them. And, for the low, low price of only $24.95, 
our heroes could become &quot;gold card&quot; members. :-) Well, actually, the 
Librarian suggested that if they want to use the secured volumes, our heroes would
need to donate a book of great importance to the Library. Such a book as a lost 
Elven Book of Days, from about 5000 years ago, which was last seen in the company
of the Great Red Wyrm Tharizum, somewhere in the tops of the Granos Mountains...
</P>
<P>
With that goal out of reach, our heroes returned to C&aelig;lwynn. There they
discovered that the Mayor of Selenica had decided to run for a seat in the Wayland
Assembly, when the elections are held during Growfest. He will be running on a 
platform of, &quot;What was good for Selenica, is good for Wayland.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
Hygulf and Skeeve decided that he must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
So, they, along with Ongen, the Telekinetic in the Knights of the Mind, teleported
to the Halfling Shire, in Wayland, where the Mayor of Selenica was going to stop
for the night on his way back to Selenica. By kidnapping him while he is in transit,
our heroes hope to avoid any confrontation with Costanza himself...
</P>
<P>
The Halfling Shire is a pretty place. It is a medium-sized town, but everything
is to a short scale -- there are only two inns in town with high enough ceilings
for humans to stand up in! Our heroes arrived a few hours before the Mayor of Selenica
did, and selected rooms in the Big Folk Inn, since all the rooms in the other inn,
the Silver Dragon, were reserved for the Mayor's party.
</P>
<P>
As the Mayor's group paraded into town, Hygulf spotted a familiar face in a 
carraige: Lilith, the astral-projecting Psionicist of Costanza's!! She was acting
as a bodyguard for the Mayor, as were the twenty or so BIG fighter types with
the procession. After the procession passed, Hygulf noticed another familiar face:
the assassin. The Mayor started to speak the the crowd of halflings and Hygulf
spoke quietly with the assassin. Maybe their objectives were the same? She agreed
to meet Hygulf later.
</P>
<P>
That evening, Hygulf and the assassin met in the Big Folk Inn. They discovered that
the assassin was in town to kill Lilith, not the Mayor! Although she wouldn't say
why, the assassin decided to work with our heroes: She would kill Lilith first, very
quietly, and then they would be open to do whatever they liked to the Mayor. Hygulf
agreed.
</P>
<P>
That night, our heroes watched as the assassin deftly put a poisoned blowgun dart
into Lilith, while she slept. Immediately, Skeeve moved close to the Mayor of
Selenica in the astral plane, and used his Teleport Other power on him. After
he failed several times, Hygulf tried the same thing. Finally, it worked, and the
Mayor was teleported to a cell in the dungeon of C&aelig;lwynn! Of course, by that
point the other Psionicist staying with Lilith had noticed the astral presence, and
attacked Hygulf mentally! They fought for a few minutes, but then Hygulf decided 
that he wouldn't last much longer and left the scene quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the Big Folk Inn, our heroes were left with very little power. Ongen was
the only one with enough to do any long-distance travel, so he created a Wormhole
as far as he could: to the shore of the Tunwalch Bay. There, our heroes sat on
the beach to meditate.
</P>
<P>
Next week: Will they make it back home safely? Can the Mayor of Selenica be 
un-dominated? What will Costanza do in response? Find out next week!
</P>
