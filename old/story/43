Reaping 28 - Goodmonth - Harvester - Brewfest, 1900:
</P>
<P>
We now step into long-term time for a bit, while our heroes get their plans in order. Autumn arrives during Goodmonth, and most of Harvester is spent, well, harvesting, for the folks living in the town of Earnsige. Brewfest brings &quot;Tax Day&quot; in Wayland, which our heroes toast from a distance, since it does not apply to them. And, of course, Castle Earnsige holds it's own small Brew Festival for the town, featuring the one pub in the area.
</P>
<P>
First, though, our heroes argued with King Hrethrew for a while longer about the location of a portal to the South. Finally, they gave in, agreeing to place it in C&aelig;lwynn, but privately deciding to create their own shipping empire from Earnsige. 
</P>
<P>
With that settled, Hygulf and Skeeve spend the lion's share of their time in private meditation. Each manages to learn a new Discipline and raise an attribute. Hygulf learns Telepathy and becomes even wiser in the ways of Psionics. Skeeve teaches himself Clairsentience and becomes more intelligent. Beyond the mediation, which lasts for upwards of 10 hours each day, our heroes attempt to set up their castle and psionic academy.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve tracked down Jeffrey, the slave who had run Zachery's Father's household, whom they had promised to hire when they had a place of their own. Jeffrey agreed to be the seneschal for Castle Earnsige, and moved his family from Hu&aelig;tburg via Skeeve's wormhole. 
</P>

Hygulf contacted Master Brand to see if he was still interested in being the headmaster for a school to train new Psionicists. Master Brand agreed to take the job this time, and he moved to the castle as well. As one of his first duties, he worked with Hygulf to write a letter of introduction that would be sent to the King of Beogar, the Overking of Athmyr, and the Assembly in Wayland, offering their services.

&quot;While psionics may still not be the most accepted of professions, it is now apparent that no country will be able to properly defend themselves without a cadre of Psionicists fighting for them. We propose to train these Psionicists for you, making sure they have the best instruction and a peaceful outlook towards the world, so that you can count on them when in need and not fear them other times.&quot;

Early in Goodmonth, the Assassin had a talk with Hygulf. She is not the settling-down type and the lack of travel and adventure made her quite bored. Despite Hygulf's sad look, she asked to be taken to Gothos so that she can catch up on &quot;her work&quot;. Hygulf wormholed her there and said goodbye, hopefully just for now...
</P>
<P>
In this way, months pass. The town of Earnsige is relatively happy under their new lords, the castle is redecorated with more monastic trappings, and Shalinar is now hunting the woods around the town looking for druids. Be here next time when we either spend two months with Zachery or begin subverting the world order via trade!
</P>
