Reaping 11, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, our heroes prepared for the big battle to come. Before dawn, Hygulf astrally projected himself around the battleground to gather information. He found some interesting tidbits, too: First, that the orcs had been very efficient at digging tunnels under the no-man's-land surrounding the castle. Within a day or two at the most, they would be under the walls. The entry to the tunnels was hidden in a tent near the edge of the Orc camp, safely behind their guards. Hygulf mapped the extent of the diggings, so the dwarves would not be surprised if the orcs dug upwards.
</P>
<P>
Second, he observed the Orc chieftan going off by himself to a small cave in the side of a mountain at the edge of the forest. He tried to follow, but could not enter the cave astrally; it was protected somehow, similar to the "cubes" he had run across in the underdark and in the ruins of Ruander. So Hygulf woke Skeeve and they teleported to the cave to have a look.
</P>
<P>
The cave was dark, darker than the night outside, and their lantern refused to penetrate it. Carefully, Hygulf stepped across the threshold. Now he could see that the place was a small temple to the orc gods: there was an altar with an icon of the one-eyed orc god on it, a number of ritually slain orcs piled up behind it, and a strange looking door at the back of the cave. Evil, reddish light came from the crack under the door. Hygulf decided to open the door and was astonished -- it opened onto a great outdoor plain which looked remarkably like Hell! Worse, there was an army massing in the near distance, facing the direction of the door. Hygulf closed it quickly.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf and Skeeve decided that they had to destroy this temple and seal the door at the back, so that the orcs didn't have any unnatural reinforcements. The immediate approach may not have been the best, though. Hygulf grabbed the icon from the altar and he and Skeeve teleported away with it. 
</P>
<P>
They appeared on the Island of Ruander, near the cube they had previously found. Since it had held a demon captive, maybe it could disconnect the icon from its god? However, they found the island less deserted than before. In fact, they had appeared in the midst of a camp of slavers! Since they didn't have time to fight, our heroes immediately teleported back to Castle Coensige, still carrying the icon. Skeeve wormholed it into the giant pits of lava underground, hoping that if it weren't be destroyed, at least it would be hard to find.
</P>
<P>
Finally, they tell Lord Eadbalth about the cave and their destruction of the icon. Eadbalth retorted with, "Are you stupid? That will just make them mad!" There was nothing to be done about it, though. The troops were all in place, so the battle had to go on. And it did!
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, the dwarves and men had the clear advantage: better reconnaissance, better weaponry, better quality troops. All the orcs had were numbers...
</P>
<P>
During the battle, Hygulf and Skeeve helped move troops and equipment around. Skeeve was assigned to the dwarven catapult, which he moved twice to good effect and Hygulf moved the dwarven elite warriors into the thick of things. Zachery and Dhak had the most effect, though, diving down on the orcs with a dwarven wizard who threw fireballs as "dragon breath". The battle raged for only an hour or so, before the remaining orcs started to run off. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the retreating orcs ran into the tunnels, to hide from their attackers. Hygulf led the elite dwarven warriors down into the tunnels, but was nearly killed by a deadfall trap. After that, the dwarves led. The tunnels were full of traps and ambushes, but once the dwarves had the orcs cornered, they butchered them. Hygulf had to leave, before he was sick. These dwarves hated orcs with all the passion they had.
</P>
<P>
Once the cleanup had settled down, our heroes turned to the task of sealing the cave. Dhak brought several large boulders and kicked them into the cave, nearly filling it. Then one last, large, flat rock was propped up in front of the cave mouth as a door. Dhak held it in place, wings beating for leverage, leaving some room at the top where Skeeve poured in hot lava. As soon as the lava started to seep out, Dhak slammed the boulder against the stone, which melted slightly, sealing the cave forever. All the dwarven engineers clapped, saying they couldn't have done it better themselves. Well, not much better... Well, actually...
</P>
<P>
So, what next? The army needs to get home and then it's on to Castle Earnsige, our heroes' new home. Right? Be here next time!
