In this episode...

Our intrepid adventurers graduate from their training in the hidden academy.
However, the finals can be just that... final. Will they survive? Will they be
found out by the local population and burned at the stake? Stay tuned!

<A NAME="RTFToC3">First meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Our intrepid heroes have set off on their graduation quest: to find the GREAT
GOLDEN HOLY SYMBOL OF TYR (may his justice apply to us all) in the ruined
monastery up in the mountains. Things were going just fine until the horde of
Orcs arrived! The team (you need to come up with a company name sometime)
managed to kill a Fourth level rope (really a poisonous snake!) using their
fledgling skills and some help from the panther. Realizing that they couldn't
fight them all at once (especially with the leader's amazing saving throws
against fear), they outwitted them and traded places: the company behind the
locked door and the Orcs outside, trying to fight an insubstantial Hygulf. Now
it is only a matter of time until the Orcs chop down the door -- 20 minutes to
prepare themselves for attack or to high-tail it down the secret staircase into
who knows what danger. Beset on all sides, the company will have a hard time
surviving ... Graduation Exercises.

<A NAME="RTFToC4">Second Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Well, it was a wonderful time once again -- for everybody except the orcs! 
</P>
<P>
Last episode we learned why telepaths are feared by all sane people: once
they've seen you, they can kill you from great distances, hidden away,
completely protected, where you will never be able to find them in time. It
takes time -- about 5 hours for a first level telepath to demolish an Ogre, but
unless you realize what's happening, it's too late...
</P>
<P>
One person, a man in black robes seen in the shadows of the twilight, must have
realized his peril. After catching the party unawares and holding two, they
just barely escaped. All hail to Hygulf's quick thinking and the fact that
psionics are completed with a mere thought! The mysterious man is long gone
now, obviously in awe of the party's powers. But who was he? Will he reappear?
Where did he go? These and more questions may be answered this week in the next
episode of... Graduation Exercises.

<A NAME="RTFToC5">Third Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
What has gone before:
</P>
<P>
It was a strange day for our intrepid adventurers. After the end of last
session, when they were locked in a closet hiding from a "horde" of zombies,
this session went remarkably well. 
</P>
<P>
Much Dimension Dooring discovered that the complex was larger than anticipated
-- with a section composed of 3' high passages to the south. The torture
chamber that the zombies were guarding looked recently used -- luckily, no one
was there at the time! So, another avenue was examined: in the room where the
Ogre used to live (before having his brains blasted out) there was a locked
&amp; bolted door. Behind the door were two merchants, captured last week by
the "forces of evil" and waiting for the Ogre to get hungry. As Skeeve opened a
D-door to escape, they were fearful -- "Are you a mage?? Why are you wearing a
sword??" However, their fears were assuaged and everyone was transported back
to the cave. 
</P>
<P>
The troops were still scouring the hillside as they left, so discretion was
absolute. Skeeve discovered that the dull, dreary cloak he had found at the
Ogre's place seemed to hide him from others' sight as long as he didn't move --
an elven cloak! But, that wouldn't be able to hide the two escaped prisoners as
they trekked back to Hu&aelig;tburg.
</P>
<P>
So, Dream Travel was called for. Hygulf brewed a potion (from herbs) to make
them sleep for a while and Skeeve dreamed them to town. But, a surprise awaited
him -- the man who had ran away (the evil leader, it is assumed) was in town
spreading vicious rumors that you three were... evil Psionicists!!!! (And it
was working well. The priest of Tyr in town verified this with a spell. He
claims his god has given him the power to detect evil Psionicists, but it has
not yet detected master Brand.) 
</P>
<P>
Leave it to the party to come up with a great idea -- mental discrediting.
While the man was sitting in a tavern, a great *fear* came upon him... a dread
that everyone was trying to kill him... he ran for the door, pausing only to
knife the waitress who had served him soup and then nearly killed someone else
in the street... and then the power failed. A couple of hours later mental
contact was reestablished, but he was wary and knew that he was being
manipulated. His power over the townspeople was ruined, though, so it *may* be
safe to return home after the conclusion of ... Graduation Exercises!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC6">Fourth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Our intrepid heroes have completed their first quest! Culminating in a meeting
with Baron Blackhawk and his council, the party has found the lost Golden Hand
of Tyr in the abandoned monastery and returned it to the Church. Of course,
along the way they were in danger for their lives from monsters and even their
own friends in town! Life may never be the same for the three -- the specter of
being identified as "mind-witches" will hang over their heads. It isn't quite a
case of "accusation = guilt", but in some people's minds there will always be
doubt...
</P>
<P>
Luckily, the Baron isn't one of them. He thanked them graciously for bringing
news of this threat to the town -- a horde of evil Gnolls and Men less than 10
hours away is something the Captain of the Guard *really* wanted to know -- and
for returning the holy icon to the Church of Tyr, thus forgiving their accuser.
Would the Baron change his mind if he found out that our heroes *lied*
beautifully at the council meeting? Probably. :-)
</P>
<P>
But, no rest for the weary. Now the Baron wants a couple of the group to lead a
small commando force to the Monastery. He needs to know: Who? and How Many? and
other details about the possible invaders. Of course, he can't say that their
won't be danger in this mission, but he doesn't know the half of it: in the
face of danger, can our heroes still manage to hide their powers from the troop
of armed men on their own side?
</P>
