Patchwall 16 - Sun'sebb 7, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Not much activity by our heroes over these couple of months. Zachery and Hygulf
spent the time in meditation, to become wiser. They discussed wisdom (or its
lack) in all its forms. And, they pondered for a week on the wisdom of
Faustus's actions... since he is almost as wise as they are. 
</P>
<P>
Faustus, meanwhile, decided to take a trip. Before he left C&aelig;lwynn, he
spoke at length with Brigadier Earnlaf about the people in the court of Beogar.
The late king had three sons, aged 18, 14, and 12. The eldest is now the king,
and is the most politically astute of the three. The middle child has spent his
life learning such "unfit" tasks as picking pockets and sneaking around. The
youngest is generally good, and a quick learner, but at least three years away
from the age of majority, at 15. So, if the oldest son has been dominated by
Costanza, then the best hope is the youngest -- and a really good regent.
</P>
<P>
Since the coronation was put off until the new year, Faustus and Geronmen flew
to Athmyr to ask the Overking for his help in raising an army to fight the evil
Illithid. One night on the way there, our heroes stopped in a village for rest
and Faustus was asked to pass judgment on some criminals. (The traveling
Lawgiver wouldn't be by here again for several months, and the villagers didn't
want to hold the criminals that long.) He accepted and found out some facts
from the case.
</P>
<P>
Two young men were accused of murdering a woman. It seems that the two men
fought over who would be able to court her, and she intervened. Unfortunately,
a knife was involved, and she died of the wounds later that day. However, no
one knew which man actually killed her. Faustus prepared to judge, and
contacted Zachery for help. Zachery looked into the young men's minds and
discovered that they had both had their hands on the knife, but dropped it...
when it fell on the woman's leg and cut her. She died of infection soon after.
Faustus decided that neither man should be hanged, but both should work on the
woman's parents' farm for six months, and think about the virtues of peace.
</P>
<P>
When Faustus and Geronmen reached Telandyr, the capital of Athmyr, they were
met by H&aelig;moc, the Beogaran Ambassador. He "prepped" them to meet with the
Overking, and arranged an audience within the week. On the appointed day, the
three went to the court and Faustus was heard by the Overking -- who appeared
to be a decadent, effete snob, more interested in court intrigue and pastries
than a war brewing under his very doorstep!
</P>
<P>
On that note, Faustus and Geronmen left Athmyr and returned to Hu&aelig;tburg.
</P>
<P>
Faustus then made a much faster trip to the Elven Magical Library, to see what
the autobooks had written about Costanza. While he was there, he looked in the
book that is writing about our heroes and found that Hygulf was not mentioned
anywhere! "Strange," he thought, but had no reason for it. Several of the elves
in the Library asked about Hygulf, and said that Bigby was looking for him.
Faustus agreed to pass on the information.
</P>
<P>
The notes from Costanza's book showed that he had spent his time gathering
strength and political allies from the area. Costanza had met with the
ambassador from Beogar (the new king) a couple of times, but it was not
recorded that he had dominated him. Still, some psionic powers are not
mentioned in the autobooks... no one knows why.

<A NAME="RTFToC39">Thirty-Seventh Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Sun'sebb 8 - 11, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Great activity these few days! During his meditation, Hygulf (now Hrethgol, a
half-elf through permanent metamorphosis) began to question the wisdom of
hiding the encounters with the demon from Faustus. Zachery, of course, thought
that telling Faustus would be like signing one's own death warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone returned from the cave where Hrethgol and Zachery had been meditating
(Faustus stopped there on his way back from the Library). Hrethgol became
Hygulf again for a meeting with Rathwyn, the Baron's mage. Rathwyn told Hygulf
a little about the Summoner's Council, and suggested that Donnson of Athmyr was
probably the least likely member to slay Hygulf on sight. With that in mind,
Hygulf thought that he might talk to Donnson and ask forgiveness for releasing
the demon on Selenica. Hygulf later asked Master Brand to ask the psionic
members of the Summoner's Council to "put in a good word for him."
</P>
<P>
While Hygulf was out, Faustus, Geronmen, and Zachery were back at Hygulf's
house in Hu&aelig;tburg. There an old woman, named Siennar, came with a message
for Hygulf to meet her at the inn. Faustus was suspicious, and checked to see
if the woman was evil -- she was! Really, it was our old friend the assassin,
in disguise. Faustus immediately tried to make her tell him the whole story,
but Zachery stepped in and stopped him. By the time he was ready to lay chase,
the woman had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf heard this, and immediately went to meet the woman. Faustus and Zachery
were on his heels. Hygulf and Zachery decided to confuse Faustus, so that
Hygulf could talk to the assassin alone. They managed, but Faustus became
*very* angry. The assassin told Hygulf that the Summoner's Council had laid a
huge reward on Hygulf's head, and that hundreds of assassins could be looking
for him. As Faustus nearly caught them, Hygulf teleported himself and the
assassin across the river, for some peace and quiet. They talked, but not for
long.
</P>
<P>
By this time, Faustus had discovered that he could not contact Hygulf. It was
as if Hygulf didn't exist, psionically! Zachery had to pretend to be injured in
a psionic mental duel, to keep Faustus from hurting him really! Finally, Hygulf
arrived and told Faustus about the demon...
</P>
<P>
Faustus nearly killed Hygulf right there. But, he knew that good things had
come from the act, and it had been performed with good intentions. Still no
real excuse, but some doubt as to how *quickly* to kill Hygulf. :-) Faustus
went to talk with Lawgiver Sigmund about it. Sigmund tried to divine the truth,
but the lackeys of Tyr that he spoke with told him that they could not decide
unless Hygulf took off his amulet, so that they could look into his soul. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Hygulf took off the amulet and Sigmund's divination went through.
As Sigmund told Faustus, "Tyr's will will be done, and he will be punished, but
it will not be by us." Faustus accepts that, and lets Zachery and Hygulf know
that he won't hurt them. But, he is still upset over the lack of trust that
they had in him.
</P>
<P>
All this had made Hygulf realize that he needed to lift the weight fully from
his shoulders. He suggested that they all go with him to visit Donnson and see
if he could apologize. So, our heroes teleported to Athmyr.
</P>
<P>
They found Donnson's tower without too much trouble. Inside, the mage
recognized Hygulf immediately and went to inform the rest of the Council.
Shortly thereafter, he returned and took Hygulf with him to meet the Council.
</P>
<P>
The Summoner's Council heard Hygulf's argument, and decided to be lenient. They
only asked that he never do it again, and he provide for them two items: the
amulet and a certain book. The mages described the book, and its probably
location, and Hygulf immediately recognized that they were talking about the
book that he and Skeeve had found several months ago. He agreed to their terms,
and was taken to procure the book.
</P>
<P>
Bigby, who transported them both to the Granos Mountains, allowed him to rip
several pages out of the book, and burn them, so as to avoid giving away the
full secret of such a powerful magic. When the ashes from the pages were safely
back inside the sealed room, Hygulf returned with the book. The mage took it
and sent Hygulf back to his friends in Donnson's tower.
</P>
<P>
Finally, our heroes teleported back to Hu&aelig;tburg, to prepare for the
upcoming coronation of the new King of Beogar.
</P>
<P>
Be here next time, when we discover just how much Faustus still trusts the
others, what the assassin is doing in C&aelig;lwynn, and whether or not all the
assassins heard that the Summoner's Guild called off their hunt of Hygulf!
</P>
