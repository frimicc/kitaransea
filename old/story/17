</H2>
<P>
Fireseek 28 - night of Readying 1, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes kept up the ruse that Skeeve was Nethoc for five whole days... but
it's six days between Alpans and Hu&aelig;tburg. Of course, the fact that Skeeve
was borrowing Nethoc's body for this trip made the disguise almost perfect.
</P>
<P>
Things started happening on the third day from Alpanas. The second sentry of the day
included a strange man who could blink (teleport-like), who even though he was under
the influence of Phobia Amplification, still questioned Nethoc (Skeeve) roughly. Finally,
he blinked away and didn't come back. Skeeve had his troops tie up the rest of the 
sentry post without speaking to them. :-)
</P>
<P>
The next day, the Ketite troops with Skeeve at their head were to reach the first Beogar
sentries. But, who had told the sentries they were coming!
</P>
<P>
Hurried diplomacy involved Hygulf and Zachery, who teleported to the Baron's castle to get
some official orders to give to the sentries. Unfortunately, the Baron couldn't order the
troops, since they only took orders from Commander Folcly, in Theodward. So, the Baron
wrote a letter to Folcly, and our heroes went to Theodward.
</P>
<P>
Commander Folcly was not happy to see our heroes. Well... he was busy. He and the other
commanders were planning a massive attack on Alpanas, since they had noticed that a large
number of the Ketite troops had left. Our heroes managed to talk him into writing the 
orders to let the defecting Ketites pass, but were very leary of the planned offensive.
They teleported to the sentries immediately, gave them their orders, and waited until 
Skeeve and his troops arrived.
</P>
<P>
The next couple of days of marching through the Beogaran snow were relatively peaceful,
but our heroes on the night after the fifth day, the real trouble started...
</P>
<P>
Three men teleported into our heroes' tent in the middle of the night: The first was
obviously a Mage, the second was one of the other Division Commanders from Alpanas, and
the third was a <B>BIG</B> man with two short swords! At first it seemed that they wanted
to talk, but our heroes decided to attack first and ask questions later! The battle was
joined!
</P>
<P>
Little did they know that their three opponents averaged 14th level!
</P>
<P>
Immediately, the attacking mage cast a Fear spell... Hygulf missed his save and started
running away -- at his fully enhanced speed of six rounds per one normal round! It looked
*grim* for our heroes... for two whole rounds, the attackers pretty much pounded Skeeve
into the ground. Zachery played dead and tried to get a good contact with the mage, but
he managed to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
Finally, on the third round, Hygulf came back. He teleported into the middle of the 
fight and immediately turned it around! The next two rounds were all Hygulf, as he 
attacked the two fighters. Of course, Skeeve was lying on the ground by this point, but
Zachery finally *did* get into the mage's mind and used Invincible Foes on him... he
went down with Hygulf's next tap!
</P>
<P>
The guards in and just outside the tent finally regained their composure after the fifth
round and rushed in and pinned the three attackers to the ground. Our heroes were badly
wounded and sorely depleted of power, but they managed to tie up the attackers and rest.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="Story48">Forty-eigth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Readying 2 - 4, 1900:
</P>
<P>
The first thing our heroes did after they rested was to try to get all the magic 
items they can off of their attackers. ;-) One item in particular proved troublesome:
the mage had a magic tooth that wouldn't come out, even when Hygulf practically 
melted the surrounding bone! 
</P>
<P>
But the important thing was to get the prisoners to a place where they couldn't 
escape. Hygulf and Zachery wormholed them all to the castle in Hu&aelig;tburg. There,
they got to hear some bad news: the Beogaran army had already attacked Alpanas and
seemed to be winning! But the Baron didn't know anything more about it. He took his
*real* sword, &quote;Snick&quote;, and dragged Rathwyn to help interrogate the captured
mage. It turned out that the mage was none other than Otiluke (as in <I>Otiluke's 
freezing sphere</I>), and he had to be let go. With his magic items. :(
</P>
<P>
The other two prisoners would be held until they could be traded for important Beogarans
who had been captured by Ket. The Division Commander was named Alpanrew, and his
bodyguard was Selman. They were put into good, new cells under the Baron's castle.
Meanwhile, our heroes joined back up with the troops.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the troops arrived at the abandoned monastery! Skeeve left to meet with the Baron,
and they talked about how to deal with the newcomers. When he returned to the troops, 
he gave a great speech about how good it was in Beogar and how nice the Beogarans were.
The next day, the Baron himself came up to the place and brought with him enough staff and
food to serve a great feast for everyone! A good time was had by all, and Skeeve gave the
speech about wanting to become an adventurer, so that the troops would not go looking 
for Nethoc later. 
</P>
<P>
After the feast, our heroes teleported to C&aelig;lwynn, to let Skeeve get back into
his own body. They talked Eadbad, the priest, into coming down and removing the curse on
Nethoc -- the one that came from the girdle of femininity/masculinity that he wore 
constantly. Suddenly, Nethoc's big, strong body became that of a beautiful (but still
<I>very</I> strong) woman. Almost immediately, Skeeve transferred his mind back into his
own body, which had been very much weakened by the time apart. When Nethoc regained
consciousness, she screamed with rage and threatened to kill everyone she could see!
</P>
<P>
Hygulf tried to calm her down, with some obvious facts:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
Even if she went back to Ket, they wouldn't know her now.
</LI>
<LI>
Even if she did convince them that she was Nethoc, they would probably put her on
trial for desertion -- an automatic death sentence.
</LI>
<LI>
She doesn't look like the most wanted <I>MAN</I> in Ket at the moment and she should
be grateful.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
After that, she calmed down enough that our heroes could safely leave. They went next
to tell the King about their adventure, and he told them some of his problems with his
generals.
</P>
<P>
As a reward, some magic items changed hands... Be here next time to see if war between
Ket and Beogar will continue to sweep up our heroes, or if they can go back to concentrating
on Costanza!
</P>
