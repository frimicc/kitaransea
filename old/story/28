Wealsun 12 - 15, 1900:
</P>
<P>
So, Hygulf and Zachery were waiting for Skeeve's return when suddenly his body vanished! Confused and dismayed, Zachery immediately tried to contact Skeeve, but was too confused and ended up with total failure! Hygulf became astral to see if there was anything happening on that plane, but could find nothing out of the ordinary. Dead ends.
</P>
<P>
What to do next? They had to find Skeeve! Even though it was the middle of the night, they woke Bernden to see if he could help them perform a <I>Retrospection</I>. Bernden agreed and took them to see Leofbod, a high-ranking member of the Knights of the Mind, who could help them perform the ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in the middle of the night, our heroes gathered in Bernden's study and asked the Psionic residue of the universe what had happened to Skeeve. The spirits gave back the following information (in a curmudgeonly way...):
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Skeeve has fallen through the fabric of the world and ended up in Baator, the plane formerly known as &quot;Hell&quot;.</LI>
<LI>He is not trapped there, per se, but isn't moving back to reality any time soon...</LI>
<LI>When asked how our heroes could help, the spirits replied simply, &quot;Go get him!&quot;</LI>
</OL>
<P>
With their next direction decided, Hygulf and Zachery needed a way to reach the plane. Hygulf could take them or bring them back, but not both without sleeping in-between... not a great comfort. So, they asked Leofson, the Court Mage, if he had any advice. He was not happy about being awakened so early, but suggested the Summoner's Council might not be happy about the trip. It would be wise to get their blessing before leaving. As for the act of traveling, Eadbad, the King's personal Priest of Tyr, might know more.
</P>
<P>
Eadbad was also less than happy at being awakened, but when he heard about the dire circumstances, was more than happy to help. He knew something about Baator and helped plan the provisions and schedule for the journey. But, he himself was not powerful enough to take our heroes. So, he took them all to visit the Lawgiver of C&aelig;lwynn, Eadlund, his superior.
</P>
<P>
At this point, Hygulf, Zachery, and the Assassin (who had finally woken up) were more concerned than ever about the journey ahead. Would they make it back alive? Would Skeeve find his own way home and they were going in vain? So, it was time for another &quot;message from the future&quot;. The plan: When they left for Baator, they would put a note in a chest. If Skeeve returned, he would see another note telling him to put a note in the chest, and when they returned, they would put in another note. Hygulf went ten days into the future to see what notes had arrived... The chest contained only a note from himself saying, &quot;We left and took the portal that Eadlund told us about.&quot; No return notes.
</P>
<P>
It was time to ask the next person for help. Eadlund was very not happy about being woken up before dawn. Still, he did admit to knowing of a <I>portal</I> to Baator which existed in the Great Temple of Bane near Gothos... assuming it wasn't ruined when that place was sacked! He produced written directions to the portal along with the activation instructions, which included &quot;killing an innocent on the threshold!&quot; (It was a Banite portal, after all.) The Assassin had no problem with that, but the others were a bit put-out. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the packs were ready; it was time to go. Our heroes made their first stop at the home of Donnson of Athmyr, to ask what the Summoner's Council would say about their trip. Donnson didn't even stop eating breakfast to chat with our heroes, but he did say that only members of the council could travel to other planes. Could our heroes join up? &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;there's a long drawn-out initiation process, which would probably make the point of your trip moot. Why don't you just go and we'll talk about it if you return.&quot; When our heroes return, they will likely be met by a Summoner, who will take them to the Council, where Donnson will vouch for them... we hope.
</P>
<P>
So, it was off to Gothos. Upon arriving, Hygulf began his meditations and the Assassin wandered off to find &quot;an innocent.&quot; Zachery examined the ruined temple and, aghast at the damage and destruction, still managed to find one small stairway into the basement levels which was still open. He returned to where Hygulf sat just in time to see the Assassin arrive with two doves in a small cage and a lamb. &quot;Just in case it doesn't work the first time,&quot; she said.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes vetured into the unknown. Very quickly, they came upon a goblin with a spear, who they scared off. Without any trouble (except the strange noises following them, echoing down the tunnels) they reached the spot of the portal. The Assassin killed one of the doves and poured the blood on the floor and suddenly an opening appeared. It was a shimmering space inside a small archway which looked out onto a reddish, dark land. Everyone pushed through and vanished from our reality.
</P>
<P>
Baator smelled bad. It was dark and rusty colored. Our heroes stood on a precipice looking down on a flat plain that extended to the horizon, which was filled with people and things. Hordes. Thousands upon thousands of beings moved and writhed on the plain below -- the hosts of Hell. Behind them on the plateau was a huge castle, rising impossibly high into the sky, with towers sprouting from towers, looking a little like they had grown that way... According to Eadlund, this was the Castle of Tiamat, the great Evil Queen of Dragons. Skeeve was here somewhere...
</P>
<P>
Zachery attempted to contact the only thing he could -- Skeeve's intelligent sword, Glordoranel. He succeeded! The weapon, and Skeeve, were a few miles away on the other side of the castle. Hygulf opened a wormhole to that position and they pulled Skeeve through. Safe! Well, sort-of. Hygulf nearly instantly started to use <I>Probability Travel</I> to make their getaway. Moments later, our heroes were all back on the Astral plane, looking for the color pool that would lead home.
</P>
<P>
They traveled for hours, but still hadn't found the right place. Hygulf needed to stop for a rest, so they stopped and floated helplessly in the Astral void. Just then a ship (?!) approached -- a large longboat which was crewed and rowed by bipedal hippopotomi! The leader looked at our heroes and laughed. He demanded a toll, any treasure our heroes had, to pass by. After only a tiny bit of discussion, Zachery handed over one of his gems to a hippo that floated down from the ship. The hippo (who called himself a Gif) took the gem and floated back to the ship equally effortlessly. Then the ship, dream, nightmare, or reality, floated past on its way to wherever.
</P>
<P>
So, we left our heroes in literally the middle of nowhere. WIll they make it back to reality? Will the Summoners hurt them upon return or let them join up? And what about that room at the bottom of Castle Earnsige which started all this? Be here next time!
</P>
