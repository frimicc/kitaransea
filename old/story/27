Wealsun 10 - 12, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes had to act quickly -- the mad druid's fireball had set part of the forest on fire! After minor indecision, Hygulf grabbed the assassin, Zachery grabbed the druid's equipment (stripped from him last episode), and Skeeve prepared to do some psionic firefighting as they ran out of the trees through a break in the ring of fire.
</P>
<P>
Out of range, Skeeve opened a wormhole from under the sea to the air above the fire, dropping enough water to put out the fire completely in a couple of minutes. While Skeeve was occupied, the others noticed that there was a crowd gathering in the nearby village, with all eyes focused on the torrent of water appearing from nowhere above the trees... 
</P>
<P>
Prudently, our heroes wormholed back to C&aelig;lwynn as soon as the danger to &quot;their&quot; new castle and village was past.
</P>
<P>
Safe in their quarters in the King's castle, the Illuminati (still feels weird) had an extended discussion about their future plans, Costanza, the castle, and Ket. Hygulf has changed his mind about the castle, seeing it as a place to get trapped by Costanza and be a target for other, less friendly, assassins. Zachery, on the other hand, continues to look at the bright side of Costanza's rule in Wayland -- no crime, no homelessness, no poverty, no unemployment. &quot;Why is it so bad if he brings order to one country?&quot; Zachery asked. &quot;Because he won't stop there,&quot; was the unanimous response.
</P>
<P>
That evening, Zachery took the druid's magic items to Leofson, the court mage, for identification, on the way to a private dinner with the King and his top advisors. There was some apprehension about how to describe Fatima's (the assassin's current alias) position within the group, but luckily the issue did not come up. Our heroes were illuminated about some current events by Bernden, the head of the Knights of the Mind: The Beogaran army is still in Ket, occupying the town of Alpanas, but they haven't lost any more ground. The King isn't interested in pushing his luck again in Ket... In Wayland, Costanza continues to be the &quot;darling&quot; of the Assembly. With almost half of the members under his direct or indirect control, Costanza could be nominated for Lord High General within the year.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Zachery picked up the <I>Ring of Protection from Evil</I> and <I>Thunderstaff</I> from Leofson. Leofson convinced him that the staff was useless to anyone but a mage, so Zachery sold it to the mage for 1,500 gp worth of gems. 
</P>
<P>
A plan had been made: send an &quot;eviction notice&quot; to the current tenants of Castle Earnsige, sealed by the King. Our heroes wrote a notice --
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To the current tenants of Castle Earnsige:<BR>
We, the Illuminati, have bought all rights to Castle Earnsige from the <BR> previous landowner, with the permission of King Hrethrew I of Beogar.<BR>
You have one day to vacate the premises and remove all of your belongings.<BR>
<BR>
Signed, <I>The Illuminati</I><BR>
Sealed by King Hrethrew I of Beogar
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Skeeve astrally projected to the castle to watch as Hygulf teleported the letter onto the current occupants' dining table. The leader of the brigands holding the castle received the sudden appearance of a scroll on top of his breakfast with very little surprise. He read the note, laughed, and then passed it to his two lieutenants who were eating with him. &quot;I wonder if anyone dropped in to see our reaction,&quot; he said. One of his lieutenants looked around -- and noticed Skeeve! 
</P>
<P>
The brigand pointed out Skeeve's presence to the others, who immediately left the room. The remaining lieutenant told Skeeve that he was going to stay and watch him until he left the castle. Skeeve took this as a challenge and zipped up through the ceiling. The brigand turned incorporeal and followed! (So he was a psionicist! Uh-oh.) The chase lasted for several minutes as Skeeve tried unsuccessfully to lose his pursuer. Finally, they had it out -- mental combat. 
</P>
<P>
The combat didn't turn out quite the way the brigands expected: Skeeve won entry into the other's mind. Skeeve probed him and discovered that these brigands aren't related to either the Dark Master or Costanza. They work for themselves. Quickly, the brigand ejected Skeeve, but he already had the information he wanted. Skeeve waved good-bye and dropped through the ground into the Underdark, to map some of the local tunnels and look for treasure.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve finally returned to C&aelig;lwynn that evening. Over dinner, he told the rest of the Illuminati about his discoveries. They suggested that he go back in the middle of the night when the brigands were asleep and examine the bottom level of Castle Earnsige's keep for treasure. When he did, later, Skeeve found that the lowest level was blocked from astral projection! A protective sphere surrounded the entire area. Since it had to be a magic spell, Skeeve tried to use <I>Subjective Reality</I> to ignore the sphere, but received a catastrophic failure and was plane shifted out of reality!
</P>
<P>
So, next time: where'd Skeeve go? Can he get back to the Prime Material Plane in one piece? How can the rest of our heroes help him? And, what will Fatima, the assassin, do...
</P>
