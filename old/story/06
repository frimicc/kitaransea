Reaping 20-22, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Well, Lareth has been destroyed! The town is picking up the pieces! Everything
seems to be going well...
</P>
<P>
But, there's some fallout from the battle. Ex-Brother Faustus was seen both (1)
running from the enemy after challenging him publicly and (2) teleporting.
(well, blinking, really, but the peasants don't know the difference.) So,
everyone in town approaches him rather... shall we say circumspectly? They seem
alternately afraid of him and derisive of him. Even through his thick head, it
seems that it may be time for Faustus to move on to fresher places...
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rest of our heroes are treated well. There is a banquet, a
hanging, etc. The Baron knows that Faustus did his best, but it doesn't help
him regain favor in the eyes of the public. During the ceremonies, Zachery and
Skeeve notice that the assassin is in town -- and unsuccessfully try to keep
that knowledge from Faustus. He gets up, in the middle of the ceremony, to go
apprehend her! Luckily the Baron explains to him that it doesn't matter now --
what Hu&aelig;tburg needs now is a celebration, not vengeance. It may or may
not have sunk in, but Faustus sat back down.
</P>
<P>
So, our heroes had to decide what to do next. Two important messages arrived
from different sources -- and leading two seemingly different directions.
</P>
<P>
Faustus heard from Lawgiver Sigmund that the church had discovered that the
army Lareth led was raised by a "Lord Balzac", from the area around Telos in
Ket. Since Beogar doesn't have the power for an all-out war against Ket, they
can't do anything about this knowledge... but if an unallied person, such as a
fallen paladin, happened to make it to Telos and confront this evil man...
Faustus needs no more urging, and is ready to leave immediately on his quest.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Master Brand comes up with the worst news possible: Costanza
is free. Reports arrived saying that the camp around the tomb was decimated --
everyone killed except for the 5 master psionicists who are missing. A huge
hole was blown in the side of the tomb, possibly caused from the inside, and
Costanza was missing. Some agents thought they saw him in Selenica later that
day. Selenica, 50 miles away and a large trading city, used to be the capital
of Costanza's Autarchy. There were at least a hundred Waylander soldiers in the
camp around the tomb when he escaped -- there are no survivors.
</P>
<P>
So, our heroes decide that the proper course is to head for Selenica to see if
they can do something to help. Faustus believes his quest is the more
important, but will accompany the others to Gothos on his way. The three leave
Hu&aelig;tburg, despite the fact that Hygulf is off exploring the mountains for
a new home and doesn't know that they have gone.
</P>
<P>
In Gothos, Zachery contacts Hygulf and lets him know where they are. Faustus
returns the books to the Emperor's Library, but almost is caught by the guards
-- they know that someone had taken these books and brought them back. Who
knows what the Emperor will do to such a person?...
</P>
<P>
Stonne, the mysterious librarian from the Elven Library in the Telos Mountains,
finally contacts our heroes and tells them what he found out about the "eye of
fire" symbol: it was used during the beginning of the Autarchs years as a
recognition symbol for Illithid travelers who were advising the Autarchs on how
to gain power. After then, it became widespread as a sign for those who were
"under the power" of the Autarchs. 
</P>
<P>
So, were the rebellious Network members who were at Costanza's tomb working for
the Illithid? Is Costanza? And who are these Illithid, anyway? Can Faustus take
on Lord Balzac? We'll find out next week!
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC19">Seventeenth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Reaping 23:
</P>
<P>
We started and ended with intense drama this week. Master Brand was up half the
night talking over the Network and found out that Costanza was seen leaving for
Granthar, a small village outside of Telos under the control of Lord Balzac.
Coincidence? We think not. The Network believes that he means to meet with the
"Dark Master" that our heroes discovered early on. Since our heroes were going
that direction, the Network suggested that they spy on the meeting and find out
what it is about. 
</P>
<P>
Since Brand was out of PSPs, Hygulf volunteered to fly the information to
Gothos. In the form of an eagle, he made it most of the way before dark. In the
morning, he met with the others at the Inn of the Red Lantern, Zachery's
favorite haunt. What he didn't realize was that the others were still fighting
over where to go next! Finally, he intervened, explaining that time was of the
essence -- Costanza had been gone for nearly a day already. So, Zachery entered
the mind of a *cow* outside Granthar and found an unoccupied barn to serve as
a teleport landing area. (No comments about "Mad Zachery Disease", please! :-)
)
</P>
<P>
Reaping 24: (well, it started in the middle of last paragraph, but I didn't
want to break the narrative there)
</P>
<P>
Once in Granthar, our heroes realized that they had *no idea* where the meeting
was. Zachery contacted Lord Balzac's Seneschal (who has had his mind invaded
more often than people who watch game shows) and discovered that they were
meeting in the dungeon. Of course, he couldn't get the details without probing
the Seneschal -- from close distance. So, our heroes walked through the village
to go to the castle.
</P>
<P>
Their first stop was a simple Weaver's cottage, to get appropriate clothes --
the plate mail worn by Faustus was a dead give-away that they weren't poor
petitioners. Of course, Zachery tried out his new power of False Sensory Input
to buy the clothes for nothing. Of course, Faustus put up an argument. After
convincing the weaver that one or the other of them was insane, Faustus was
calmed by Hygulf and told to return to the barn and keep quiet. Faustus was
unhappy, but seemed to see the importance of the situation...
</P>
<P>
Until he saw a coach carrying a Priest of Bane and a little girl driving into
the village. The madness came upon him and he slew the priest almost instantly.
The Baneite only had time for one spell, which made Faustus blind. The girl ran
into the village screaming, turning everyone's head to the coach down the road
and the man in the plate mail and bloody two-handed sword standing over it.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the rest of the party had reached the Seneschal and tried to
get him to talk for a couple of minutes. Long enough for the probe to work, but
definitely too long for our heroes limited conversational skills. Hygulf
pretended to be overcome with pain to manage the time. The local acolyte of
Bane came rushing out to heal him, and then took him into the *evil* shrine to
pray. Luckily, Hygulf escaped before being forced to listen to a sermon on the
power of Bane!
</P>
<P>
As they left the castle, our heroes heard the screaming and knew that Faustus
must have caused it. Hygulf ran to help the paladin, while Zachery and Skeeve
snuck into the castle while the guards were chasing Faustus. Zachery and Skeeve
holed up in a closet to rejuvenate.
</P>
<P>
Faustus heard the screaming and the peasant crowd running towards him and
realized that the madness had left as quickly as it had arrived. He teleported
into the barn and tried to hide in the straw. Being blind, he didn't know if it
had worked. Luckily Hygulf was the first one in and grabbed the booted feet
sticking out from under a pile of hay. He transformed into a giant eagle,
grasped Faustus in his claws, and flew away. The peasants and guards tried to
follow the flying pair, but couldn't keep up. The eagle stopped a good twenty
miles from town and then the two tried to relax and hide. Hygulf was not happy
that he had to pull Faustus's butt out of the fire, but Faustus could only
think of getting back to the village and burning all of the Baneite-constructed
buildings to the ground.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Skeeve used his new power of astral projection to take a look around
the castle. He found the Dark Master and Lord Balzac in the dungeon, meeting
with Costanza. They were splitting up the known world! Costanza would be able
to take the eastern half within three years, and the Dark Master claimed that
he already had almost total control of the western half. The only thing that
could stand in their way might be some elves, such as Brimforirlan. It was
uncertain whether this elf was good or evil, but he was obviously powerful and
old. Skeeve couldn't get a look at the Dark Master's face until the end of the
meeting, but when he did the man looked like an old man. But *something* wasn't
right about the way he looked...
</P>
<P>
Reaping 25:
</P>
<P>
So, our heroes got out of there as quickly as possible and met up in Gothos.
Zachery will send his account of the meeting to Master Brand soon, and then
we'll see what can be done to thwart this all-encompassing threat. 
</P>
<P>
Will Faustus get Balzac? Will Costanza control the world? Is the Dark Master an
Illithid? And what about this elf -- is he the "dark elven master" mentioned
earlier? We'll find out next week.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC20">Eighteenth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
About two weeks earlier:
</P>
<P>
We ran a "cut" with Hygulf and Skeeve, which happened about two weeks in the
past. Hygulf had been looking for a place in the mountains with some water,
maybe food, and very difficult to get to, to call home. He flew over the range
as a giant eagle and found what looked like the perfect place: a crater (the
Granos Mountains used to be volcanic, long ago) with some grass, a couple of
trees, a small spring, and three caves leading off into darkness.
</P>
<P>
So, he convinced Skeeve to help him explore the caves in Astral form. Skeeve
entered the darkness and discovered that two of the three led into the
Underdark! They dropped into lava tubes that went deep into the earth, crossing
and recrossing what looks like hundreds more tunnels. Closest to the surface,
Skeeve ran across the lair of a hundred or so orcs. The orcs were led by a Mage
-- possibly a powerful one.
</P>
<P>
After watching the orcs for a while, Skeeve realized a few things: 1) that they
posted a guard at the entrance to their cave, (2) that they had *obviously*
been attacked before and were alert, and (3) that that meant that there were
probably lots more monsters down here... *evil laugh* 
</P>
<P>
As he continued, Skeeve ran into a party of adventurers: Berwin, a mage, and
Parred and Sienard, both fighters. After observing them for a while, Skeeve
appeared and spoke with them. The upshot is this: they started in the Cruth
Mountains, in Athmyr, and got lost underground. They've been down here six
months and are looking for the treasure of a dragon that they heard about. They
are currently based in Skullport, an evil city directly underneath Alhwick,
which also happens to be the center for Bane worship in the world! Skullport is
run by several Mafiosi, including a couple that are led by Illithid. Illithid
walk freely in Skullport, as do vampires, beholders, and other monstrous
creatures. It seems that it is the new description of "not a nice place." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Skeeve took off to search for the dragon. The adventurers had a map,
but were totally lost. Skeeve used his psionic powers to memorize the map and
then located the dragon -- who had been turned to stone and had no treasure.
Finally, Skeeve left the caves to relate what he had seen to Hygulf, waiting
outside. They decided that this would make a good home, (well, the 3rd cave
would) but they needed to get rid of the orcs. So, they returned to Berwin
&amp; co. to make a deal: Skeeve would get them out of the dungeons if they
would help destroy the orcs. Hygulf was in the shape of a Lion, this time, for
better combat. The reinforced adventurers leaped to attack the orcs -- Hygulf
killing three in the first round, and the mage leading them in the next round,
while Berwin cast a fireball into the lair that killed most of the orcs.
Obviously outpowered, the orcs surrendered and the two fighters killed the
remaining women and children.
</P>
<P>
The group went up to see the sky and rejoiced a while. Finally, Berwin decided
that his group would return to the underdark, to continue adventuring. Skeeve
and Hygulf decided to look at a strange area underground -- a room which was
sealed from the astral plane! Hygulf turned into ectoplasmic form and slipped
into the room through a solid wall and picked up a book with a ripped page. Our
heroes took the book and page to Rathwyn, the court mage in Hu&aelig;tburg, to
have it identified. Rathwyn told them that it was a "very dangerous and old
spell book, containing one very powerful spell." He will translate it and copy
it, but it will take him a month or so. 
</P>
<P>
Then, our heroes rejoined the timeline with new information, a new home base,
and the Underdark awaiting them...
</P>
