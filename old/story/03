<A NAME="RTFToC10">Eighth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
We played through a single day last week, but the 21st of Planting was a major
occurrence: the Templar arrived.
</P>
<P>
The resurgence in Bane-worship (at least possible Bane worship) brought to
light by our heroes forced Lawgiver Sigmund to send to Alhwick for help. His
superiors in the church sent Bruder Faustus, who just finished his 18 years of
Templar training. (they start wayyy young) Faustus (brought to us by Nick...
Welcome, Nick!) conducted an investigation into the claims made by the town's
Herbalist and Singer that (1) they had found an old, abandoned monastery in the
mountains and (2) it contained a bunch of humanoids and evil men and (3) said
people were led by a Baneite Priest. 
</P>
<P>
The interrogations weren't torture -- at least not quite -- but did last most
of the day. In the end the Templar was convinced of the truth of our heroes'
story (but not without some heavy skepticism). Zachery and Hygulf spent a lot
of time in worry, consulting with Master Brand, their teacher, and even the
Baron Blackhawk himself to hopefully temper Bruder Faustus's ...
investigations. Certain topics were avoided, but unfortunately the Templar
learned of the accusations of Psionics against our heroes. They were discounted
by Sigmund and the Baron, so no more action was taken ... yet.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes were informed that they would be helping the Templar with his
"Cleansing Mission" to the evil monastery soon.
</P>
<P>
On a side note, Ous, the psionic who attacked our heroes a few days earlier,
vanished as soon as the Templar was seen. It was later discovered that he spent
some time at the Logging Camp on the other side of the river that night. He
came back with the news that he had two days to find the 500gp that he owes the
Loggers or his arms and legs would be broken. And, luckily, there was no sign
of the Assassin who has plagued our heroes...

Planting 22nd, 1899: 
</P>
<P>
Having concluded his investigations, the Templar decided to plan for the
upcoming assault on the abandoned (not really anymore, is it?) monastery. The
breakfast meeting included the Baron, his advisors (Captain Leofbalt, Rathwyn,
Lawgiver Sigmund, and Brian of Wayland who was verrrryy quiet) and our heroes.
It was decided that only 20 men of the town's forces could be spared, but that
included Lt. Grath and his scouts -- admirable men all! The plan was to go into
action on the morrow.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the Templar Faustus met with the adventurers staying in
town. It was strange, since they were full of sarcasm which the strict Templar
did not seem to notice, but they decided to join the quest. Oh, and if anyone
happens upon a ruby the size of your head, they *really* want to know...
</P>
<P>
Our heroes spent the rest of the day meditating, to be prepared for the trek.
They were interrupted at midnight by a knock on the door...
</P>
<P>
23 Planting:
</P>
<P>
It was the assassin! She came in and told a wild story: Lareth had refused to
pay her for attempting to kill our heroes, making her rather upset. The reason
he gave was that he now had a "legion of troops" at his disposal and they would
"take care of things". She decided it would only be fair to warn the
unsuspecting heroes that their expedition in the morning would be walking into
a trap! This was confirmed through mindlink, but only after it was discovered
that the assassin had been trained to resist contact! She gave minimal
information on the procedure, but confirmed that she met with "an old man who
wore a dark cloak and kept the hood over his face". He had a hawkish nose, but
no other distinguishing features she could see. Unwilling and unable to press
further, our heroes LET HER GO! (will they live to regret that? *evil laugh*)
</P>
<P>
They immediately ran to tell the Baron. He wasn't too unhappy about being woken
up, but after the explanation made a decision: the mission would continue. The
only way to discover if there were 100 men up there was to send a group up to
look... and it would be much better if there were 30 or so than if there were
only 5. "By the way," he said, "don't tell anyone else about this. We don't
want to unnecessarily frighten anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Before dawn, our heroes went to Master Brand's to ask his advice. He used his
Clairvoyance to scan the area around the monastery and found -- a catapult!
Maybe the assassin's words were true? But, with no way to explain their
knowledge of the siege weapon, our heroes met the expeditionary force silently.
The adventure began!
</P>
<P>
The group consisted of the Templar Faustus, Capt. Leofbalt, Lt. Grath, 4
scouts, 15 troops, Hygulf, Zachery, the panther, and Ous -- who decided to come
look for his stolen money. Several hours into the march, the thought appeared
that there might be a spy in the group. Bruder Faustus scanned for evil intent
and found... Ous! (Hygulf: "I told you he was evil." Zachery: "Yeah? You were
going to give him your money!" Hygulf: "Yes, but I didn't trust him." *snicker*
) Immediately, the Templar threatened Ous at sword point to confess his evil,
but Ous refused. He said that he wasn't evil and was a steadfast follower of
Tyr. Faustus was all for killing him then and there, but Zachery pled his case:
they needed all the help they could get against the hundred men waiting for
them...
</P>
<P>
It seems that the Templar had not been informed of the possible "legion of
troops" waiting at the top. He was not amused. When that was settled the second
strike against Ous came: Faustus felt someone try to contact his mind.
(speculation is that Tyr has granted him some power to detect and repel
contact. Otherwise he would have to have (1) learned psychic defense from a
psionic master or (2) BE PSIONIC. Neither of which seems logical...) Well, it
was all that they could do to keep him from spitting Ous on his two-handed
sword. After much heavy argument, Faustus decided to allow Ous a "trial by
fire" once they had camped that night.
</P>
<P>
In camp, a dagger was heated and Ous's arm burned badly. If it started to heal
by morning, he was not a mindwitch, but if it hadn't... Luckily, Hygulf was
allowed to tend the wound. Without his cell adjustment, it looked as if there
would have been no healing by morning. Zachery slipped Ous a knife in the
night, but he had to wait for his chance to escape.
</P>
<P>
24 Planting:
</P>
<P>
Ous's wound was examined and found to be healing nicely. He was pronounced "not
a mindwitch", but evil. They tied him securely and left him for the return
trip. The scouts had discovered the catapult during the night, so Faustus and
Leofbalt decided to stay under cover as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
The first encounter was with a tribe of Bugbears sitting in ambush. The Templar
discovered them (after being warned by the panther) and the troops engaged
them. No losses, but 5 men were wounded severely and left unconscious at the
site. Their wounds were bound, but would need to be carried back to
Hu&aelig;tburg. 
</P>
<P>
After that the catapult let loose. Two men were nearly killed by falling rocks
from the first shot, but quick action by Hygulf (That's why they brought him...
the town medic!) kept them from dying. Again, they were left to be picked up on
the way back.
</P>
<P>
Finally the group reached the plateau above the monastery. They charged the
crew on the catapult and killed them all, only injuring one man of their own.
He was still conscious, and left to burn the catapult while the others entered
the ruins through the back door.
</P>
<P>
A surprise move by Bruder Faustus took the guards there by surprise and short
work was made of them. Following the tunnel into the heart of the mountain, the
Templar opened the door to Lareth's rooms -- and was greeted with 6 crossbow
bolts! Single-handedly he killed all six men defending the room, only being
wounded once. But once they were in, our heroes found a note from Lareth.
Essentially, "We're all out right now, but if you'd like to leave a message
after the beep, go ahead." No one else was found in the area.
</P>
<P>
So, we end the session with speculations: Zachery discovered that Lareth is
about 10 miles away right now -- just about as far as the town. Is he attacking
the town while they are short-handed? Does he really have a legion of troops?
Where did the assassin go and was she lying? Did Ous escape? What will Ous do
if he does? Who is Ous working for, anyway? How did the Templar detect a
psionic attack? Will he discover that our heroes are psionic? Is there any
treasure left in the monastery? (for the adventurers who came along) We'll find
out... in January. :-)

<A NAME="RTFToC12">Tenth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
second part of Planting 24:
</P>
<P>
We picked up where we stopped -- right in the middle of the dungeon. A few
moments later, our heroes recognized their surroundings and succeeded in
herding the troops toward unexplored territory.
</P>
<P>
With the Templar in the lead, they found the catacombs were abandoned -- except
for a falling grate trap. There was little doubt that our heroes could escape,
since they had come in through the back door, but they managed to lift the gate
and prop it open. Until they noticed the Orcs.
</P>
<P>
Dropping the gate behind them, our intrepid band took to their heels in a
feeble attempt to evade the pursuing orc horde (possibly a hundred orcs!). They
split up, with the Templar and Captain Leofbalt leading the orcs away from the
wounded, back toward the shelter of the cave. Once there, they fought off the
entire batch! Two against 50! HURRAH!!!  Of course, this outcome was helped
tremendously by a subtle application of psionic fear from Zachery.
Unfortunately, the leader of the orcs, a black-clad fighter bearing the symbols
of Bane, died during the battle, slain by panther-claws. (Unknown to most, the
claws were those of Hygulf, not the "real" panther... I wonder if anyone will
ever notice?)
</P>
<P>
25 Planting:
</P>
<P>
Still, the trip to town was uneventful.
</P>
<P>
26 Planting:
</P>
<P>
Celebration! A holiday was declared, and a feast was held to honor our heroes:
Captain Leofbalt and Templar Faustus received medals of honor, all the others
received Certificates of Merit. The celebrations culminated in the hanging of
the remaining Baneites in custody: the "thugs" caught trying to kill Zachery
several weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Significant visitors: during the festivities, Hygulf noticed the assassin in
the crowd, but when contacted she would have nothing to do with our heroes. She
claimed she was "working", whatever that means...
</P>
<P>
Ous also showed up, to thank Hygulf for saving his life. He admitted to being
evil and trying to kill them, and tried to pay our heroes back with a sack of
gold. Hygulf would have none of that, though, and refused it. Ous left still
owing our heroes a debt. Maybe he can be turned from evil sometime...
</P>
