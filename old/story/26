Wealsun 3 - 10, 1900:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes have finally decided to make a name for themselves! Unfortunately there may be some confusion, because they have decided to call themselves the &quot;Illuminati&quot;. :) In any case, their symbol of an eye on a triangle was put onto their brand new tabards, to be worn with their matching sets of Red Dragon scale armor. They cut one heck of a dashing figure now!
</P>
<P>
Zachery had the new tabards made while Hygulf and Skeeve waited for the King to finish preparing the documents to give them possession of the Castle Earnsige. Once the King saw our heroes in their new outfits, he immediately asked for his scutage &shy;&shy; a personal suit of similar armor. Zachery agreed and our heroes now have legal possession of a castle!
</P>
<P>
When they were ready to set off, Zachery contacted the assassin, who had decided to join up with our heroes for a few weeks after Hygulf's persuasive argument that her life was in great danger from Costanza. Everyone met in the Inn of the Red Lanterns in Gothos. EVERYONE on the street stared at our heroes in their new armor...
</P>
<P>
The assassin arrived in the guise of a noblewoman. She asked our heroes to call her &quot;Fatima&quot;, the name of Zachery's wife. Outside the Inn, Fatima's large trunk was being carried by six slaves. As our heroes prepared to depart, the assassin freed all the slaves and they ran off with their freedom papers. Finally, our heroes wormholed to the bluff overlooking Castle Earnsige.
</P>
<P>
They examined the lay of the land: the bluff overlooks the castle and a small village outside the walls. The castle and town sit atop a hundred&shy;foot cliff, which drops to the sea. The view is fantastic! The castle itself has a keep, two towers, and a curtain wall, surrounding a few wooden and stone buildings. In the sea at the foot of the cliff, a sailing ship was anchored. 
</P>
<P>
As our heroes watched, a rowboat left the ship and headed towards the cliff face. It didn't return until almost an hour later, unladen. Skeeve went to investigate astrally. He saw the ship was full of pirates, unloading heavy chests into the rowboat. He followed the boat into a sea cave, which contained a small sandy beach. On the beach were a number of sailors unloading the boat. The chests were carried over to a lift and winched up through a long shaft into the basement of the castle keep. Skeeve left the unloading and looked around some more, noticing the basement of the keep contained some dungeons and a torture chamber. In one cell was an old woman who was asleep.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve returned to the heroes and gave his report. While he had been gone, the assassin had changed clothes into reddish leathers and changed her facial features, too! She now appeared about the same age as our heroes, but, of course, more beautiful than any of them. ;) The Illuminati (feels weird to write that...) discussed looting the treasure, but decided to wait until it was all loaded into the castle, so they wouldn't need to move it later. They sat down to wait...
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a tree behind them changed into the form of a druid! The man pounded his staff on the ground, temporarily deafening our heroes. Then he attempted to tell them that he meant no harm. Our heroes saw his mouth move and his hands move and misinterpreted it as a spell being cast and prepared to attack. Hygulf reached the druid nearly instantly and knocked the man unconscious.
</P>
<P>
Stumped by this attack, the Illuminati stripped, bound and gagged the man and tended to his wounds. While he slept, Zachery tried to probe his mind to discover who he was and what he wanted, but to no avail. When he finally woke up, he changed into a wren and flew away. Zachery contacted him again and spoke into his mind, &quot;Who are you? Why are you attacking us?&quot;
</P>
<P>
Enraged, the druid cast a fireball at our heroes! So he was more than just a druid... With the battle fully joined, Hygulf stormed up the hill to where the druid stood and proceeded to rip him to shreds.
</P>
<P>
Calming down, Hygulf noticed that Fatima had been hurt badly by the fireball and went to heal her. Our heroes decided to rest and wait until nightfall before going down into the castle.
</P>
<P>
Be here next time when the Illuminati go underground! How will they clean out the castle? Who was that masked man and why was he so stupid? We'll find out.
</P>
