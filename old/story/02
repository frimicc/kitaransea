<A NAME="RTFToC7">Fifth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
After taking a week to train to second level, our intrepid heroes then took up
the task of scouting for the Baron. Hygulf and Zachery led a troupe of 5 of the
Baron's best scouts, including the eminently practical Lt. Grath, back to the
Monastery to determine the enemy's strength. A lone Bugbear was captured and
interrogated, divulging the fact that there were only about 30 troops in the
area. 
</P>
<P>
While performing "close" scouting, a scuffle was heard near the
back-door/secret tunnel entrance to the complex and a scout was lost. He turned
up later, but it is assumed that he was charmed and released. Law-giver Sigmund
of Tyr dispelled the charm when the team returned to town.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that our heroes were to suffer a worst fate -- an assassin! A
strange woman beckoned Zachery to meet her in the dark, where she was waiting
with four "big tough guys with clubs". He thought better of it and instead
brought the town watch into the picture. Worried about his safety as he slept,
a watchman stayed in his room in the inn that night -- and was found dead in
the morning with a quarrel in his neck!
</P>
<P>
Using his mental powers, Zachery traced the assassin to a barn a few miles away
into the hills. Unfortunately, our heroes arrived too late to catch her, but
did find out that she had some means of fantastic transportation... minutes
later, when she was next contacted, she was 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the off-hand comment made by her about "being able to defend
oneself against a mind-witch"??? Will the characters be slain in their sleep?
Will they be forced to leave town? What will happen next? ... we'll find out
this week.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC8">Sixth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Well, the assassin failed again! (Luckily. :-) )
</P>
<P>
It was a *really* close call -- Even with police protection, Hygulf was within
inches of his life! 
</P>
<P>
It started that next morning, when two men showed up to relieve the guards
watching our intrepid heroes. The newcomers *weren't* really members of the
town watch, but pretended to be. However, it didn't fool our heroes, who tried
several times to alert the guards being relieved. As a matter of fact, the
guards weren't fooled either, but Hygulf and Zachery didn't seem to catch that
fact... So, all 6 went off to the Ringing Bell Tavern for breakfast -- where
they saw Captain Leofbalt. This cemented the doubts in the guards and our
heroes minds. When the Captain's presence was pointed out to the two impostors,
they tried to run but were handily laid-out by the guards. Maybe being
protected by the watch wasn't so bad after all?
</P>
<P>
The action had made the Ringing Bell too busy a place, so the group trouped
over to the Hawk Tavern (it's a two-tavern town) for their breakfast. When they
arrived, our heroes noticed a certain woman sitting inside -- the assassin!
Zachery went to get more guards, but the assassin made a run for the back door.
Luckily, Hygulf and escort made it there in time... unluckily, the assassin was
waiting for him with a gleam in her eye. She quaffed a potion and turned
invisible. A minute later she reappeared, trying to stick a dagger in Hygulf's
back! The knife caught on the edge of his shield as he turned around in
surprise, stopping it from cutting straight through to his heart. (His
forethought helped too -- he had already initiated Flesh armor and Adrenal
Enhancement in preparation of the obvious melee.) Then the panther attacked. It
was visibly upset by the attack on it's best friend and showed it by shredding
the assassin's armor and putting deep marks in her back as she attempted to
escape. She made it to the woods at the edge of town (just as it started to
thunderstorm!) before she was caught, but she was *badly* wounded and probably
a ten-hour hike in good weather from any real healing.
</P>
<P>
So, as our heroes went back to Hygulf's Herbalist Shoppe to rest and meditate,
were they given any rest? No! Within a few hours, a Psychic Messenger appeared
-- the image of a hunchbacked, stooped man claiming to be called "Ous". He
challenged our heroes to a psychic duel in the hills just down-river from town.
Hygulf used his newly learned Dimension Door to bypass the guards protecting
him and to reach Master Brand, their teacher, for guidance. He used
Clairsentience to "scout" the area for the duel and found that it was the
night-camp of a tribe of goblins working with the man from the image. Beyond
that he wasn't much help. :-(
</P>
<P>
Will our heroes accept the challenge? Will they try to chase down the assassin
and finish her off? Will they all be killed in a freak volcanic eruption? Who
knows???? We'll find out next week.
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC9">Seventh Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
On the 20th of Planting, our heroes figured out what to do about "Ous", the
psionicist who had challenged them to a duel for no apparent reason last week.
Master Brand discovered that he had studied under Master Wigwald, a master in
Beogar who lives just outside of Alhwick. Master Brand also told our heroes
that no one knew anything about the so-called "Dark Master", and if they could
find out anything it would be greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
So, Zachery and Hygulf decided to send a message to Ous suggesting that they
meet that night just outside the town wall. It was accepted, and that night
they all met on the river bank just beyond the sight of the town guards. Ous
showed up on time with some of his Goblin guards and the fight began!
</P>
<P>
Only two or three exchanges were made, because both combatants rolled a 20 in
one round: Zachery couldn't use his only attack mode for 4 rounds, and Ous
suffered major feedback and couldn't use any psionic powers for several hours!
So, suddenly, Ous turned and ran. Hygulf and his panther gave chase and
attacked -- nearly killing him. When Zachery caught up, Hygulf opened a
dimension door to let them travel back inside the town wall quickly -- before
the goblins caught up!
</P>
<P>
They made it. *whew* Then a hard discussion followed, as to whether they should
bind the wounds on their opponent. They decided to, but brewed a sleep potion
to keep him unconscious until they could decide what to do with him. Master
Brand came and looked into his mind to see why he had challenged them. Later,
when Ous woke up, the full story came out:
</P>
<P>
Ous is the son of a master trader in lumber in Alhwick. He was sent north to
Hu&aelig;tburg with the guild payment for this month, because his father knows
he is a psionicist and thought he could defend himself and the 500 gp payment
successfully by himself. Just south of Hu&aelig;tburg, he was ambushed by
goblins... He defended himself pretty well, using mostly his power of "inflict
pain", but was overwhelmed and taken prisoner. The goblins beat him up badly
and then took him to visit Lareth (the old foe) in the abandoned monastery.
Lareth talked to him and "all of a sudden he seemed like my best friend". After
the "talk", Ous was sent back with the goblins to "get rid of" our heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Master Brand discovered much of this before Ous awoke, including the "best
friend" part. Our heroes assumed he was charmed, and took Ous to Rathwyn, the
court Mage, to have the spell removed. He did so for free, but told them that
usually it would have cost several hundred gold pieces for this service. It's
good that he owed Zachery and Hygulf a favor...
</P>
<P>
So now it is the 21st of Planting. Ous has tentatively joined our intrepid
heroes in their quest to damage or kill Lareth and his gang of Bane-worshipping
fanatics. So what will they do? What about the assassin from last time? Will
the goblins try to attack the town? We'll find out next week.
</P>
