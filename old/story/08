Goodmonth 15 - 20, 1899:
</P>
<P>
This week was a "re-grouping" week for our heroes. Hygulf and Skeeve arrived in
Hu&aelig;tburg and met with Master Brand. He examined the two swords that they
had collected and tried to "read" them.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf's sword provided a lot of information to Master Brand. The previous
owner of the weapon had been a young elven warrior named Athenwing, who had
fought for the forces of good against the evil Autarchs. He was killed in
battle at Ruander and then his short sword was put in the armory for the next
1500 years. However, very little was discovered about the weapon itself.
</P>
<P>
Skeeve's sword, on the other hand, was much more reluctant to give up its past.
All Master Brand could discover through its resistance was that the last owner
had been a male elven warrior a long time ago. Master Brand believes that the
sword has telepathic powers, and intentionally concealed its past from his
object reading. Ominous...
</P>
<P>
After our heroes had rested, they asked Master Brand to contact their
companions. He contacted Zachery and asked him to return to Hu&aelig;tburg with
haste, to discuss plans for the future. Zachery contacted Faustus, and tricked
him into returning to Gothos to take both of them back to Hu&aelig;tburg.
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, Zachery had spent the time "relaxing" in Gothos at
his favorite haunt, the Inn of the Red Lanterns. Faustus had been gone longer,
searching for a way to defeat the evil Baneite Lord Balzac. One night he had a
dream about a wonderful war-horse, which he knew to be a sign from Tyr that it
was time to search for his Bonded Mount. In a second dream after Zachery
contacted him, Faustus was told to interrupt his quest to go with his
companions -- there was more important work to do!
</P>
<P>
Once they were all in Hu&aelig;tburg, they discussed their next steps. It was
decided to go find Brimforirlan, the possibly-mad elf who was last seen in the
nearby Granos Mountains. To that end, Hygulf met with the Dwarven ambassador
from the mountains to arrange for our heroes to travel to the Dwarven
stronghold of Kar-agun and "borrow" a Dwarven tracker to help them search. 
</P>
<P>
On a side note, Faustus's armor had been finished and arrived in
Hu&aelig;tburg. He picked it up from the castle and then went to see Sigmund,
who it seems had paid for its delivery. Sigmund declared that it was the least
he could do -- Faustus deserved more, but he was still outcast from the church.
They discussed many things personal and religious.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who usually traveled alone, allowed our heroes to join him in
his trek back home. Preparations were made during the week and on Earthday the
group set off for the mountains. They hiked with their mules up to the ruined
Monastery that night and slept within its walls.

</H2>
<P>
Goodmonth 21 - 22, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Finally: Battle! As our heroes marched/climbed up the steep mountain trails,
they ran into a small party of Orcs. Quickly, the orcs were dispatched by
everyone, but Faustus would not allow the bodies to be looted. However, when he
found the symbol of Bane on their shields, he personally hacked the remains to
bits! The adventurers moved farther down the trail before resting.
</P>
<P>
As Hygulf rested, Zachery and Ambassador Kragin went forward to scout for other
trouble and Faustus went back to examine what was left of the orcs. The two
found nothing, but heard orcish horns and shouting from back where the battle
had been. They ran there to find that Faustus was in trouble again!
</P>
<P>
He had seen two more orcs looting the bodies and charged them. They ran, but he
chased them through the forest. Finally he caught them and killed them -- that
was when he heard the horns. By his own estimate, there were probably 200 orcs
coming towards him. Yet, he stood his ground, secure in his faith that Tyr
would save him if need-be. The orcish army surrounded him and Faustus
challenged their leader to single combat. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Boggrot came forward... wearing full plate armor and carrying a huge
warhammer stolen from the dwarves! The two champions clashed for several
minutes until Faustus was victorious! As the remaining hundreds of orcs swarmed
upon him, he teleported back to the rest of the group and (relative) safety.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes ran for a while, until they came to a chasm next to the path. On the
other side was a cave where they could hide. Hygulf opened a Dimension Door and
they all helped push the mules through to the cave. It looked like they were
safe from the orcs, but something in the cave smelled wrong to the panther...
</P>
<P>
Examining the back, our heroes found another cavern and a sinkhole leading down
into the depths. They left the Ambassador to take care of the mules and dropped
Zachery on a rope into the hole. It opened into a nearly circular tube slanting
down for quite a ways. Part of the way down a dwarven skeleton lay, as if it
had died trying to crawl or fight its way up the tube. Zachery knocked it down
and it fell for a while before hitting the bottom. As he descended, he noticed
that the bottom opened into the side wall of a *gigantic* cavern. 
</P>
<P>
The other two followed Zachery down and they held a conference at the edge of
the huge space. As they were deciding to circumnavigate the cave, they thought
they saw a light on the opposite wall. Faustus immediately set out to
investigate, forcing the others to follow or be left behind. He was in such a
hurry that he nearly fell into a river that ran through the cavern. The others
caught up with him and they all decided to explore a little more carefully...
</P>
<P>
The cavern had several passages leading out of it in various directions, each
labeled with a marking in a strange script. Hygulf's sword, Inforanel, believes
the markings are ancient "Dark Elven" navigation codes, but could not explain
more than that. It assured our heroes that the Dark Elves were wiped out
thousands of years ago and no longer exist, even underground... 
</P>
<P>
As our heroes explored further, they were attacked by several disembodied hands
that crawled and leaped to grab at their faces! These undead beasties were
killed unceremoniously, but raised eyebrows all around. A little later our
heroes ran into a couple of orcs resting in a room. They were not Baneite orcs,
but Cyricists under the command of chief Nazgar. After questioning, Zachery and
Hygulf allowed the orcs to run away, despite Faustus's attempts to kill them.
</P>
<P>
<P>
So, what *else* is down here? How many orcs live in these mountains? Are the
Dark Elves really dead? What more does Inforanel know about this place? And,
will our heroes even live to reach Kar-agun, let alone find the elusive
Brimforirlan?
</P>

<P>
Goodmonth ?? -
</P>
<P>
Our heroes started out underground and just about finished there too!
</P>
<P>
After the escape of the two Cyric orcs, Faustus went after them. Hygulf
convinced him to let him look around first, so he changed into a lion and
tracked the orcs to a *huge* chamber. At one end there was a guarded tunnel,
which looked like the orcs lair. 
</P>
<P>
However, before they could storm the place, the orcs rushed out to greet them.
Faustus shouted through the hail of blows that he wanted to fight their leader,
but no one appeared. A large spider, hanging from the ceiling far above, seemed
to watch the battle, but took no part. A few minutes into things, Hygulf was so
badly wounded that he needed to retire. He ran back to the room with the river,
and leaped onto a ledge in the wall to hide while he rested.
</P>
<P>
Faustus was overborne by the orcs, but through his great strength managed to
regain his feet. He, too, was forced to flee ("I withdrew... I didn't flee," he
says) and teleported back to the entry cave where Ambassador Kragin was
waiting. Faustus immediately crawled back down the tube to the large cavern, to
save the tired and outnumbered Hygulf.
</P>
<P>
Hygulf finally regained enough strength to Dimension Door across the river --
just as the orcs brought out boats! They crossed and charged; a battle ensued
at the mouth of the tube leading to the outside. Finally, Nazgar, the orc
Chieftain, arrived and took Faustus up on his challenge of one-on-one combat.
It was tough, but Faustus survived and wounded the chief enough that he fled.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes scrambled up the tube to the surface cave, where they met the
Ambassador. They explained the situation and he immediately jumped down the
tube into the fray! (Only later did we discover that he had quaffed a potion of
Super-Heroism and was now *much* more dangerous.) Faustus, not to be outdone,
jumped in as well -- only to be nearly killed by the orcs! Ambassador Kragin
carried him back to the top and gave him a healing potion -- along with some
advice about the better part of valor. :-)
</P>
<P>
So, the party left their cave to head to the Dwarf Stronghold. The next day
they found a small Baneite holy symbol buried near their camp and burned it.
Hygulf turned into an eagle to scout around -- and became one permanently!
(Until he turned back into Hygulf and failed that roll, becoming permanently
himself again. *whew* :-) ) While they were resting, our heroes received an
invitation to dinner with someone named Brangol - in the stronghold of
Kar-Agun. 
</P>
<P>
We ended as our heroes entered the great gates of Kar-Agun.
</P>
<P>
So, who is Brangol? Will the orcs come back for revenge? What is the meaning of
the Baneite symbol being in that place? Does Hygulf still have a craving for
worms and mice? We'll find out next week!
</P>
