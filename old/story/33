Wealsun 27-8, 1900:
</P>
<P>
With Costanza dead and our heroes f&ecirc;ted by Wayland, Hygulf, Zachery, and Skeeve sat down and planned their next move. The first order of business? Find Costanza's missing autobook.
</P>
<P>
The next morning, our heroes each received a contact from an unknown source. Moments later, someone knocked on the door of their suite. Suspecting treachery, everyone geared up for combat -- completely surprising the poor hotel servant who came in to offer breakfast! Despite their paranoia, our heroes ate healthily. :) It seems that breakfast comes &quot;on the house&quot; for heroes...
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, so do crowds of hero worshippers. Looking out the front door of the hotel, Hygulf could see almost 100 people standing around, craning their necks to get a good view, in case the &quot;Heroes of Wayland&quot; came out. No such luck for them, because our heroes were feeling anti-social and Skeeve wormholed them across town to the former spot of Costanza's house.
</P>
<P>
The lava had cooled by then, forming a nearly impenetrable tomb for the house and nearby buildings. Psionics brook no boundaries, though, so Zachery used his clairsentience to attempt to locate either Costanza's autobook or the magical quill that wrote it. (The quill is supposedly an artifact, and would therefore not be destroyed by mere lava.) However, even Psionics can't find what isn't there, and our heroes were still empty-handed. They decided to try their luck in the next most likely location: Selenica.
</P>
<P>
A quick wormhole showed our heroes another reminder of the gravity of Costanza's death. Selenica was devastated. Rioting had torn up the grass in the city center. Looters had broken into many stores and destroyed several buildings. At this point, almost noon on an Earthday, the streets were completely deserted. Our heroes headed toward the only sign of life (?)... smoke, rising from a building near the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
As they approached, they saw that the mayor's house wasn't on fire as they had suspected, but it had been heavily damaged by fighting and fireballs. More important, though, were the Wayland Army troops standing in a circle around the building, facing outward. Zachery tried to contact the last-known mayor of Selenica, but he was either dead or on another plane. Hygulf walked up to the troops and asked to see their commander.
</P>
<P>
Major Jonathan was officious and annoying, pointing out the current curfew and suggesting heavily that our heroes should quit bothering him... until Skeeve pulled out the Coin of Wayland medal he had been given. Suddenly, the major was kow-towing. He immediately led our heroes into the building and gave them the run of the place. He put his troops at their disposal. And, he told them what had happened.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Everything had been quiet, and then suddenly, the population went wild. It was as if someone had been holding everyone back and suddenly the dam burst. People lost all control: rioting, looting, burning, whatever they could do to destroy things. As things started happening near the garrison, I sent all the troops I could out for crowd control, but we ended up defending the mayor's house from a rogue wizard. After a few hours, people started to calm down, which is when I sent out the word for reinforcements and instituted the curfew. It was too late for Mayor Corbert, though; he was already dead. Many people headed out of town, but there are a lot still here, just hiding from the troops and their own guilty consciences...&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Our heroes began looking for the autobook immediately. Zachery tried to locate it using Clairsentience again, but failed. Skeeve became astral and searched the catacombs under the building for hidden rooms or extradimensional spaces. Hygulf chatted with Major Jonathan and discovered that all of Costanza's lackeys had vanished. Well, maybe not all of them... Skeeve found a man meditating in a small room under the basement. Not too far away, Skeeve also found an orc scouting party blundering their way through the maze of passages. Following the scouting party's tracks led Skeeve to the main bulk of the orc army, only a few hours away! Even worse, it looked like there was another psionicist advising the orc chieftan.
</P>
<P>
What to do? Well, our heroes have never been short of plans. Hygulf talked with Major Jonathan to get his troops ready for combat. They went down to the basement and found that there was no good way to seal off the catacombs. The best they could do was to place a man on guard there, so as to get a little warning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zachery turned his senses on the meditating man and discovered that he was an evil high-level psionicist! He attempted to contact the orc chieftan, but could not, due to a Tower of Iron Will that someone had placed around the chief. (another psionicist?) Finally, Zachery contacted all the members of the orc scouting party and left them a post-hypnotic suggestion to attack the meditating man they seemed like they were going to meet. Then, Skeeve became astral again and went to wait in the room with the meditating man.
</P>
<P>
The orcs knocked on the door of the room, which woke up the man waiting. He calmly stood up as the door opened, and was taken completely by surprise when the orcs rushed to attack! He mindflamed them all, killing most of the 10 orcs in a single motion and incapacitating the remainder and the ogre that led them. While this went on, Skeeve tried to open a wormhole at the level of the floor, to drop the other psionicist into the lava several miles down, but couldn't get it open! Finally, the psionicist teleported out. Skeeve returned to the others, disheartened. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was the army left to deal with. Hygulf and Skeeve hatched a cunning plan to use multiple wormholes to drop seawater on the orcs, to force them to retreat without killing too many of them. (Hygulf felt bad about all the dead innocents in Nethathon.) However, before they could put the plan into action, Skeeve went to watch the army and found that it was retreating anyway! There was no sign of the psionicist who had been with the orc army. He must have been contacted by the other man and fled. Without him driving them, the orcs decided to go home.
</P>
<P>
Our heroes caught their breath. Unfortunately, it was only a couple of minutes before they received a contact from somewhere in Selenica. Another minute, and the contact was much closer. Our heroes rushed from the room, Hygulf in the lead. As they stepped out the front door of the Mayor's house, they saw the meditating man at the edge of the town square. Hygulf sped up, raced over, and shredded the man before he could do any more damage. Major Jonathan's troops were impressed, but happy to not have to fight more psionicists.
</P>
<P>
So, maybe there will be more cleanup of Costanza's followers than our heroes had thought. And where did that autobook get to? Be here next time!
</P>
