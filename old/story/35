Richfest 5 - Reaping 1, 1900:
</P>
<P>
The librarian, Stonne, was happy to have his pen back.
</P>
<P>
He decided to allow our heroes back into the Great Elven Library, but warned them not to expect any favors for some time... In the meantime, our heroes decided to follow up on the second favor they owed: helping Thiellion count dragon's hoards.
</P>
<P>
Zachery contacted Thiellion and he agreed to teleport to the Library to meet with our heroes. Once there, he explained about the project.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Right now, we are working with a very nice Gold Dragon in the Oidillaf, counting his holdings. We promised him that we would share with him the list, because he is a forgetful dragon and is not quite sure himself what he owns. We expect to be another six months or so in the reckoning. However, with your help, we could finish in half that time...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the other hand, if you don't want to help us count this stuff, maybe you could take on our next target: Gragratzod, the Great Red Wyrm of the Oidillaf. We tried to make a deal with him, but he would not allow us access to the important parts of his hoard. Maybe some excellent heroes such as yourselves will have more pull with him. If you would prefer something more dangerous and exciting, that is...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Well, if you give our heroes two options, they will take the more dangerous one every time! (sort-of) After some consultation, they decided that they could use Retrospection to determine the contents of the hoard. This would let them perform the task in record time (a day or two at the most), too. Hygulf proposed to the elf that they would get a complete list of the dragon's hoard within a week. If they could do so, then maybe Thiellion could come up with a package of work for them that they could do to &quot;buy&quot; his Amulet of Non-detection from him. He was dubious, but accepted.
</P>
<P>
So, Zachery, Skeeve, and Bernden tried Retrospection... for three full days. Finally, they managed to find the proper memories and Skeeve used Cognitive Trance to memorize the complete contents of Gragratzod's hoard. Afterward, Skeeve spent another day just writing it all down! It was an impressive hoard, too. The best part was his collection of magic swords. The dragon even had a rack custom-built to hold all 250+ of them.
</P>
<P>
While the others were busy remembering, Hygulf and the assassin wandered around the Library. They had a couple of &quot;dates&quot;, but the most fun was when the assassin showed Hygulf the hidden tunnels that honeycombed the mountain. The tunnels looked like they were constantly in use by the library staff, to move quickly between rooms and to their living quarters, but the assassin had noticed patterns in their use and found empty times to explore. She took Hygulf around the tunnels until they came to a dead end with a small opening high above. The assassin asked Hygulf if he could look behind the wall...
</P>
<P>
Hygulf became ectoplasmic and looked through the opening and saw a huge treasure chamber on the other side. &quot;It must be where the Librarian stores all their late fees,&quot; quipped the assassin. She cajoled, whined, threatened, and nearly begged for Hygulf to take her through the wall &quot;just to pick up a couple of gems,&quot; but to no avail. Hygulf did put his head through for a better look, though, and saw off to each side a remarkably life-like statue of a Silver Dragon. Remarkably life-like, those statues... 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they returned to the others and took a look at the tome Skeeve had written about the hoard. The assassin recognized it! She said that the dragon used to give tours, like a museum, but the price of admission was a magic sword, so not very many people took them. 
</P>
<P>
Zachary contacted Thiellion, who came and was awestruck by the contents of the book. He immediately admitted that Hygulf and Skeeve's debt to him was paid in full, and said that he would get back to them in a week with a long-term contract that they could fulfill in return for the elf's amulet. He was so excited that the work had been done so quickly that he nearly forgot to say goodbye as he left!
</P>
<P>
As long as they were in the Library, Hygulf asked Sylea (our heroes' personal library assistant) to research Amulets of Non-detection for them. Sylea came back quite quickly with his response: there is no known recipe for making them and the last &quot;new&quot; amulet had been made over 400 years ago. Our heroes discussed the merits of going back in time and having one made for themselves, but decided to let the matter wait a bit.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, on to the third major errand: the castle they had acquired!
</P>
<P>
Be here next time for the assult on Castle Earnsige! (finally?)
</P>
