<p>
Hygulf and Skeeve begin in C&aelig;lwynn. Hygulf asks Skeeve to contact the assassin, to set up a meeting -- he thinks her life may be in danger! She says that she is busy, but will talk to him in a few hours...
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Zachery finally comes back to Hu&aelig;tburg after flying off in a huff at Faustus. He has Dhak land on the giant boulder which covers the entire block around where Hygulf's shop used to be and gapes. A crowd of peasants emerge, shouting &quot;Only a dragon could drop a rock that big -- <b>He</b> must have done this!&quot; Zachery quickly departs for the Baron's castle. There, he discovers that no one knows the fate of his companions and the Baron is especially worried about &quot;The Great Hero Faustus&quot;. Zachery contacts Faustus and is rebuffed, but knows that he is alive and back in the far south. Then he contacts Hygulf and is told that they will meet in Hu&aelig;tburg the next day.
</p>
<p>
Hygulf and Skeeve had gone on a shopping trip to Telandyr. Hygulf, after his previous chat with the assassin, had decided to clean up a bit. Our heroes spend almost an entire day getting Hygulf a shave, bath, haircut, and a couple of suits of new clothes. (His furs smelled so bad that the tailor couldn't even burn them! *wink*) The next day, after Hygulf picked up his new outfits, they went to meet with the Assassin.
</p>
<p>
In Hu&aelig;tburg, Zachery decided that Costanza really couldn't have meant to damage innocent buildings and should pay reparations to Hygulf. He composed a letter to Costanza saying that monies should be sent to Zachery's Father's house in Gothos, since it will be easier than trying to find our heroes while they are on the road. Zachery sends another letter to his father, telling him about the incoming money...
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Zachery asks the King of Beogar if the preparations are complete for the land transfer to House Hildebec, so that our heroes can begin clearing out their new castle in the mountains. The king says that everything is approved, but there will be a few days' delay in getting the paperwork done. Everything should be set in about a week.
</p>
<p>
Back in Telandyr,  Hygulf and Skeeve go to the One-Legged Mermaid tavern, on Cod Liver Street, to meet the assassin. She comes in dressed as a female Ship's Captain, full of bluster and tactless. Hygulf, impressed by her amazing disguises, suggests that they go somewhere <i>private</i> to have their discussion. She agrees and they all leave the tavern. Outside, Hygulf teleports himself and the assassin to the crater/cave in the Granos Mountains -- thousands of miles away. That's privacy!
</p>
<p>
Hygulf tells the assassin that she is probably in great danger from Costanza for failing to kill Faustus. He offers her the best protection from Psionics he knows -- he invites her to join our heroes, so that they can protect her from Costanza. She smirks. At first, she says that she can handle anything -- she has been trained well by a grandfatherly-type man in Gothos named Erdun and his woman partner... Finally, though, she decided to take Hygulf up on his offer of help. She has an &quot;appointment&quot; in Gothos first, but she will join up with the group in about a week. While they are still in the crater, Hygulf and the assassin discuss her job a bit and Hygulf is horrified to discover that she likes what she does. As he takes her back to Telandyr, Hygulf asks Inforanel to examine her using True Sight. The sword says that he sees a 30 to 50-year-old half-elf with a magic hat, who also happens to be quite evil. Hygulf ignores that last part...
</p>
<p>
Finally, Hygulf and Skeeve join Zachery in Hu&aelig;tburg. They realize that the armor the dwarves were making for them should be finished and travel to Kar-agun to pick the suits up. The dwarves hold a great feast and unveil the finished products -- four suits of gleaming Red Dragon-scale armor, complete with gold fittings and matching boots! The dwarves raise a great cheer for our heroes, who returned the Iron Crown to them and captured the great dragon Dhakgababdorblad. All is happy and good. Our heroes return to Hu&aelig;tburg to decide what to do next...
</p>
<p>
So, will the assassin join our heroes? Who will protect whom? Will Costanza merely destroy Zachery's family or turn them all into mindless slaves of his will? :) Be here next week!
