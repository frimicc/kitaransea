<A NAME="RTFToC15">Thirteenth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Zachery dominated this week's time, by invading every mind he knew looking for
insight in what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
He looked into the minds of the group of adventurers our heroes met before, to
see if they had found the giant ruby they were looking for. They hadn't.
</P>
<P>
He looked into Lareth's mind and found him on the docks in Alhwick, sending
cases of crossbows up to Hu&aelig;tburg. Rathwyn was notified, with the caveat:
don't ask where we get our information. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
He looked into the mind of Laren, an elf acquaintance of Skeeve's, to see if he
could get our heroes into a library. Amazingly enough, the elf was nonplused
about having his mind broken into. However, he did help by revealing the
pictures of a library high in the Telos Mountains, run by elves. Stonne, the
librarian, would help them.
</P>
<P>
So, our heroes had to get to the Telos Mountains, in the far north of Ket. A
500 mile journey? Takes 2 months? Not for *our* heroes -- dream travel made it
take two days. It was a two stage trip, with a stopover in a small town on the
border of Ket and Wayland. Nothing major happened, but during the second dream
a group of elves appeared to Skeeve and gave him a strange thought: what if the
Autarch Costanza was not dead, but had instead just Time Traveled 2000 years
into the future? Scary thought... *evil grin*
</P>
<P>
Finally, our heroes made it to the library's entrance: a platform cut into the
rock, 20 feet square and a mile up from the mountain. The only way to go was
across a tiny stone bridge, to a pair of *huge* doors in the side of the cliff.
Luckily, everyone made their dexterity checks (not an easy task for our
heroes!) and no one fell to their death. However, they had to answer a question
to enter:
</P>
<P>
How old was the King of Siam when he died?
</P>
<P>
It took nearly forever, but finally Hygulf came up with "As old as he lived",
which seemed to be OK to the librarian. In the meantime, though, things looked
grim when Zachery was caught trying to probe the librarian's mind for the
answer. "Get out of my head and away from here," he said. Quick to the save,
Hygulf, "so, was that not allowed, then?" 
</P>
<P>
We ended with our heroes just beginning to search the millions of volumes for
information about the Autarch Costanza. Good luck!
</P>

<A NAME="RTFToC16">Fourteenth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
I think it's around Reaping 18 or so:
</P>
<P>
The great library contains many treasures, as our heroes found this episode.
They spent about a week here, researching the ancient Autarch Costanza and
mainly following in the footsteps of several previous researchers but finding
some new material. Interesting notes are provided in digest form:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
A few weeks earlier, a group of 7 men - two with psionicist armbands, three
in mages robes and two in normal clothes - were at the library seeking the same
stuff as our heroes. They looked to be an old and wizened group, and contained
at least 2 names of interest: Tenser and Bigby.
</LI>
<LI>
They found several books on Costanza, painting a picture of him as a typical,
but not amazingly powerful Autarch. It is rumored that he is afraid of insects
and/or spiders.
</LI>
<LI>
Our heroes found further information in the Adventuring Logs, in the
Auto-book room. These included previous encounters of Adventurers with the
tomb, and the concept that it was attacked in the past. The "eye of fire"
symbol is inside each stone of the structure.
</LI>
<LI>
Since Costanza could, in his time, control people's minds, and since the "eye
of fire" is being used by the Wayland government to mark psionicists, it is
thought that this might mean that the Autarch is controlling the psionicists
who have contacted his tomb. Maybe he is stuck inside and needs them to open
it? Maybe he is already out and is controlling them to begin his takeover of
the region? Rumors abound!
</LI>
<LI>
There were no entries in the Great Library for the "eye of fire" symbol,
which struck the Asst. Librarian, Sylea, as very odd. The Master Librarian
vanished, to research the symbol elsewhere and will report his findings to our
heroes next week.
</LI>
<LI>
Two books were found that are not in the Great Library: The Book of Dead
Rulers and The Evil of the Autarchs. The later came from a determined effort to
contact Bigby's mind. Both books reside in the Emperor's Library at Gothos.
</LI>
<LI>
Using their psionic abilities to the fullest, our heroes managed to locate
the two books, teleport in, grab them, and get out. The best thieves in the
world? Maybe...
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
We leave our heroes in their room at an Inn of Ill Repute in Gothos: books in
hand, ready to do two things. They are headed back to Hu&aelig;tburg, to help
stave off Lareth's invasion and they intend to read the books and decide how to
help defeat the returning Autarch. 
</P>
<H2>
<A NAME="RTFToC17">Fifteenth Meeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Reaping 19, 1899:
</P>
<P>
Our heroes returned to Hu&aelig;tburg just in time to find that Lareth and his
army had already attacked and taken over the town! Homes burned, ships smashed,
walls toppled, etc. It will take a *long* while for the town to recover fully.
The loss of life alone will probably cut the tax base in half!
</P>
<P>
But, never halted, our heroes came up with a plan: cut off the head and the
rest will die. After some scouting, they descended on a building near the
Castle Gate. In the cellar, plans were made and then carried out. Of course,
the Paladin wanted the first "honorable" crack at Lareth...
</P>
<P>
In a scene that will forever stick in my mind, Faustus challenged the Baneite
Cleric to a duel -- and then was forced to run, by the power of Bane! In one of
D&amp;D's weirder moments, someone decided that Paladins are creatures of their
gods, unlike clerics who carry the god's power with them, more like undead who
are physical manifestations of the dead gods Bane and Cyric. So, the cleric
turned Faustus, forcing him to run all the way across town followed by Lareth's
brutal laughter.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, the other heroes dimension doored next to Lareth, used Invincible
Foes to make him an easy target, dragged him through the door and chopped off
his head. He made the Paladin suffer an indignity, so he was forced to die in a
shameful manner. Then his lieutenants were also set upon and killed quickly,
leaving the army completely leaderless.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of town, Faustus took out his anger on anyone he could find
-- killing six men (I think) and orcs. He rescued a barmaid from the predations
of evil men, but had to show his teleport abilities to do it. Maybe they were
drunk enough to not be believed...
</P>
<P>
In these battles, our heroes showed that they can be formidable, but had to use
their psionic powers openly to do it. One can only hope that those who saw have
an open mind...
</P>
<P>
And what about the rumors that powerful priests can return from the dead???
Have we really seen the last of Lareth? We'll find out in a couple of weeks.
</P>
