</TABLE>
<H3>Adventures:</H3>
<P>The best psionicists adventure to gain a better understanding of themselves. 
The Will may be strong, but the Way is mysterious... Psionicists also adventure 
for the usual reasons: fame, fortune, advancement, and so on.</P>
<H3>Characteristics:</H3>
<P>Psionicists are masters of their own minds. In general, this means that they 
are decisive and given to introspection. In many worlds, psionicists are misunderstood 
and may be hunted by locals who discover their true nature. Because of this, 
psionicists also tend to not give away their profession easily. Since their 
powers are triggered by mere thought, they can be used even in the midst of 
a crowd without notice.</P>
<P>Of course, every Way is different. Individual psionicists may be egoistic, 
flamboyant, or even dismissive of non-psionicists.</P>
<H3>Alignment:</H3>
<P>It requires great discipline to be a psionicist. Controlling their minds and 
imposing their Will on the world requires a non-chaotic alignment. Neutral psionicists 
may seem less organized than their lawful counterparts, but they can still rise 
to the same heights of power.</P>
<P>Good and evil are both represented in the psionicist's nature. Some psionic 
powers can cause alignment drift from one to the other. Mindflame, for example, 
is an evil power and any good psionicist who uses it moves one step towards 
evil...</P>
<H3>Religion:</H3>
<P>Since psionicists control great powers of their own devising, many of them 
are not particularly religious. Much less than Clerics and Wizards, who command 
fantastic spells -- which come from outside --, the psionicist is usually the 
master of his own destiny and often feels that the gods play no part in his 
life. </P>
<P>On the other hand, faith is common among the folks surrounding the psionicist 
and that can be a powerful influence on him. Some psionicists have been known 
to be among the most faithful worshippers of Bane, Waukeen, or even Tyr.</P>
<H3>Background:</H3>
<P>Psionicsts are trained individually, apprenticed to a master psionicist soon 
after they show the talent. There are rarely any large institutions where psionicists 
gather -- most work alone and rely almost entirely on their own skills to get 
by. </P>
<P>In places where psionics are tolerated, psionicists may hold the position of 
lay healer for a village, or the position of adept. In larger cities and organizations, 
see <CITE>The Will and the Way</CITE> for more details.</P>
<H3>Races:</H3>
<P>Any race can be a psionicist. Elven psionicists, with their long lives to meditate 
and study the Way, can become incredibly powerful. Generally, though, psionics 
manifest more often in humans than in any other race.</P>
<H3>Other Classes:</H3>
<P>Psionics usually manifest in a person around puberty. Thus, most psionicists 
had no idea they were going to be psionicists until they were already on another 
path. Since many apprenticeships begin before the age of 12, there are probably 
more multi-classed psionicists than any other class.</P>
<H2>Game Rule Information</H2>
<P>Psionicists have the following game statistics.</P>
<H3>Abilities:</H3>
<P>Wisdom determines how many Psionic Strength Points (PSPs) a psionicist has 
to spend on his powers and also determines bonus powers. However, Strength, 
Intelligence, and Constitution also control a number of powers, so all abilities 
are important to the psionicist. A high Constitution improves a psionicist's 
hit points and a high Dexterity will improve his usually poor armor class.</P>
<H3>Alignment:</H3>
<P>Psionicists must be non-chaotic.</P>
<H3>Hit Die:</H3>
<P>d6</P>
<H3>Class Skills</H3>
<P>The psionicist's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are<BR>
Concentration (Con),<BR>
Craft (Int),<BR>
Gather Information (Cha),<BR>
Hypnosis (Cha, exclusive skill),<BR>
Knowledge (religion) (Int),<BR>
Knowledge (psionics) (Int),<BR>
Perform (Cha), <BR>
Profession (Wis),<BR>
Psicraft (Int, exclusive skill),<BR>
Scry (Int, exclusive skill).</P>
<P>See <CITE>Player's Handbook</CITE>, Chapter 4: Skills for skill descriptions 
of most skills. Psicraft, a new skill, works just like Spellcraft, but only 
works on psionic powers and their effects. Hypnotism, a new skill, works like 
the Arcane spell Hypnotism. The DC for Hypnosis victims' Will saves is equal 
to the psionicist's skill roll.</P>
<P>Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.<BR>
Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.</P>
<H3>Class Features</H3>
<P>All of the following are class features of the psionicist.</P>
<H4>Armor and Weapon Proficiency:</H4>
<P>Psionicists are proficient with all simple weapons plus the short sword and 
shortbow. They are proficient with light and medium armors, but are prohibited 
from wearing metal armor (thus they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor). 
Psionic powers can be disrupted by large quantities of metal, especially in 
the form of a helmet. In order to use their powers, psionicists can only wear 
non-metal armor and may never wear a helmet of any kind (unless it is psionically 
enhanced). Psionicists are trained to use shields, but must use only wooden 
ones.</P>
<H4>Still Mind:</H4>
<P>All psionicists gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells and effects 
from the Enchantment school, since their mediation and training enable them 
to better resist mind-affecting attacks. (As Monks)</P>
<H4>Psionics:</H4>
<P>Psionicists have psionic powers, as described in the following section. Each 
psionicist must choose one Discipline to be his primary discipline at 1st level. 
This discipline is eligible for bonus powers, according to the psionicist's 
Wisdom. Additional disciplines are gained as shown in the Class Table.</P>

</TABLE>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Each psionicist has a set number of PSPs that he may use each day. This number 
is determined based on the character's Wisdom, Intelligence, and Constitution 
scores.</P>
<P>At 1st level, a psionicist begins with a number of PSPs based on his Wisdom 
score, indexed in the previous table, plus his Intelligence and Constitution 
modifiers. </P>
<P>So, for example, Jackal has C 16, I 14, W 16. At 1st level, Jackal has 22+3 
(C) +2 (I) = 27 PSPs.</P>
<P>At each level above 1st, a psionicist gains 10 + his Wisdom modifier additional 
PSPs. So, at 2nd level, Jackal gains another 10+3 = 13 additional PSPs, for 
a total of 40 PSPs.</P>
<P>Even though a psionicist may not have access to the Telepathy Discipline, he 
still is able to defend himself when attacked psionically. As he gains levels, 
he automatically gains access to additional Defense Modes (Constructs) as shown 
on the Class Table.</P>
