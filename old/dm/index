<H2>Third Edition</H2>
<P>
I really like the new D&amp;D Third Edition rules published by WotC. However, they do not support the same kinds of psionicists that we have been using for years. So, I have attempted to translate psionics and the psionicist from 2nd Edition to 3rd.

<H2>The Will and the Way</H2>
<P>
We use <I>The Will and the Way</I> a lot in our game. Since TSR released it for free on the web, I hope they won't mind if I mirror it here, for our convenience.

Or, use this HTML version I converted. I haven't checked it for typos, conversion weirdness, or any other sort of QA, so you're on your own. The canonical version is the RTF file.
