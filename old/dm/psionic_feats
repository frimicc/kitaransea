<H1>Psionic Feats</H1>
<P>A new category of feats is required for campaigns that use psionics - psionic 
feats.</P>
<P>These feats all carry the prerequisite of Psionics. A character must have the 
ability to use psionics to take any of these feats.</P>
<H2>General</H2>
<H3>Psychic Defense</H3>
<P>Some non-psionics can develop a rudimentary psionic defense. They may be born 
with exceptionally strong Wills, or they may have met a teacher who instructed 
them in the basics of psionic self-defense.</P>
<P>Benefit: You can make a Will saving throw to defend against a psionic attack 
(Contact, or one of the five attack modes (Harbingers)). The DC of the save 
is equal to the roll the psionicist made to activate the power.</P>
<H2>Psionic</H2>
<H3>Crystal Focus</H3>
<P>You use a crystal to help focus your power in a single Discipline.</P>
<P><B>Benefit: </B>You can create a crystal (small, effectively free quartz will 
do) which gives you a +1 on all power checks for a single Discipline. The crystal 
can be attuned to any Discipline you know, but you can only use one crystal 
at a time. (You cannot create two crystals for different Disciplines and then 
switch off. Only one Discipline at a time!) It takes 2 hours of mediation to 
attune a crystal.</P>
<H3>Harness Subconscious</H3>
<P>You can harness the power of your subconscious to give you increased PSPs for 
a time.</P>
<P><B>Benefit:</B> If your PSPs are at their maximum, you can spend two days (48 
consecutive hours)meditating, gathering additional energy. After the 48 hours 
of meditation, you gain an additional 20% of your total PSPs. This bonus lasts 
for 72 consecutive hours, after which the additional points are lost. During 
the 72 hours of heightened strength, you still cannot recover those addtional 
PSPs -- you can only recover PSPs up to your normal maximum.</P>
<H3>Power Manipulation</H3>
<P>You can gain extremely favorable results when using powers in your primary 
Discipline.</P>
<P><B>Benefit:</B> When initiating a power, you can choose to spend an extra 5 
PSPs to automatically gain the result specified for rolling a natural 20 on 
the power check. For purposes of DCs and saves, you still use the actual number 
rolled; only the result is changed.</P>
<H3>Meditative Focus</H3>
<P>You can meditate to focus your power in a single Discipline.</P>
<P><B>Benefit:</B> You can meditate for 12 consecutive hours to give yourself 
a +2 bonus on all power checks for a single Discipline for the next 24 hours 
or until your PSPs drop to 0. All power checks in other Disciplines have a -1 
penalty during the heightened period.</P>
<H3>Rejuvenation</H3>
<P>You can meditate to regain power as if you were sleeping.</P>
<P><B>Benefit:</B> You can recover PSPs while meditating at the &quot;sleeping&quot; 
rate of 12/hour (1/5 minutes). You enter a state of deep concentration, but 
are still conscious and aware of your surroundings, so you do not suffer penalties 
on initiative or surprise and are not helpless if attacked.</P>
<H2>Psionic Item Creation</H2>
<H3>Empower Item</H3>
<P>You can create psionic items.</P>
<P><B>Prerequisite:</B> Psionicist level 10+</P>
<P><B>Benefit:</B> You can empower any item with psionic powers. Follow the rules 
given in <CITE>The Complete Psionics Handbook</CITE> and <CITE>The Will and 
the Way</CITE>, with these changes: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Empower checks always succeed.</LI>
<LI>The item has to have a gp value assigned to it, based on other items in 
the DMG.</LI>
<LI>You must pay 1/25th the gp value of the item in XP, just as for magic items, 
in addition to the PSPs used up daily.</LI>
<LI>There are no additional material components, except those mentioned in the 
Empower description.</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Create Receptacle</H3>
<P>You can create a repository of PSPs for yourself.</P>
<P><B>Benefit:</B> You can store PSPs in a valuable gem or in an Empowered item, 
as specified in the Receptacle power on page 102 of <CITE>The Complete Psionics 
Handbook</CITE>. If the receptacle is damaged or destroyed, the stored PSPs 
are subtracted from your current total, as stated in the description. You can 
still only store as many PSPs as your maximum.</P>
