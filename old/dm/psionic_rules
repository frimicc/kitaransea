<H1>Psionic Rules</H1>
<P>Psionic powers are very different from magic. Psionics are powered from within 
the psionicist's mind and body, while magic is powered from outside, usually 
other planes. Psionics are not guarenteed to work, unlike magic which has a 
recipe approach. Also, psionics can be directly confrontational, forcing one 
psionicist into mental combat with another, which has no counterpart in magic.</P>
<P>These rules are an adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, 2nd Edition 
rules, as stated in <CITE>The Complete Psionics Handbook</CITE> and <CITE>The 
Will and the Way</CITE>. Both of those books are still the canonical sources; 
these rules merely convert the information to 3rd Edition standards.</P>
<H2> Using Powers</H2>
<P>A psionicist has, at any given moment, a set number of Psionic Strength Points 
(PSPs) to spend to initiate and maintain any of the sciences or devotions that 
he knows.</P>
<P>To initiate a power, the psionicist makes a skill check for that power. If 
the check is successful, he pays the required number of PSPs and the power works. 
If the check is unsuccessful, he pays half of the necessary PSPs and nothing 
happens. The psionicist can attempt to initiate the power again the following 
round.</P>
<P>The power check is performed just like any other skill check, but with a Discipline 
Level modifier instead of a skill rank. The Discipline Level is the number of 
levels the psionicist has had access to that Discipline. So a 1st level psionicist 
who chose Clairsentience as his major Discipline would have a DL bonus of +1 
when using Clairsentience powers. At 6th level, he will have had access to Clairsentience 
for 6levels, so his DL bonus would be +6. However, at 6th level, he would only 
have had his second discipline for 5 levels, with a +5 bonus, and his third 
discipline would be new, so it would be only at +1!</P>
<P>The ability modifier for the check differs for each power. Use the ability 
mentioned in the Power Score, as listed in the power's definition. For example, 
Poison Sense is based on Wisdom, so the ability modifier would be the psionicist's 
Wisdom modifier.</P>
<P>So, to determine the result of a power check, it is<BR>
<STRONG>d20 + DL bonus + ability modifier</STRONG></P>
<P>The DC for the power should be determined by the DM. Generally, you can use 
10 - the power's power score penalty. Since the penalties are usually negative, 
that means you add the number to 10 to make a higher DC. For psychic contests, 
the DC is usually the other psionicist's power check roll.</P>
<P>So, to determine the DC for a power, it is<BR>
<STRONG>10 - (power score penalty)</STRONG></P>
<P>Special effects may occur if the psionicist rolls really well or really poorly. 
<BR>
If the psionicist rolls a <STRONG>natural 20</STRONG>, he gets the result specified for 
equalling the <STRONG>Power Score in the power's definition</STRONG>.<BR>
If he rolls a <STRONG>natural 1</STRONG>, he gets the result specified for rolling a <STRONG>20 
in the power's definition</STRONG>.<BR>
Bonuses to the check do not count towards these purposes. </P>
<H2>Regaining PSPs</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS, Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans
serif">Once they are &quot;spent&quot;, PSPs can be recovered simply by not performing 
psionic activity. However, the overall level of physical activity performed 
has a bearing on the speed at which PSPs are recovered. There are also feats 
and powers that let a psionicist recover PSPs more rapidly.</FONT></P>

<P>To take into account 3e surprise rules, a psionicist caught flat-footed (meaning 
has not yet acted in the first round of a combat) can only have Mind Blank up 
as a defense, since it costs 0 PSPs and is assumed to be constantly maintained 
at all times. When a psioncist has a chance to act, he can choose which of his 
available Defense Modes to use for the next round. The choice remains until 
his turn to act comes in the next round.</P>
<P>Psionicists can still make 2 attacks in a single round with each use of an 
Attack Mode and unlimited defenses with each use of a Defense Mode.</P>
