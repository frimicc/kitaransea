## Who did this?

We are a small Advanced Dungeons & DragonsTM (by [TSR, Inc.](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/)) gaming group in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our emphasis is on Role-Playing, not combat or number-crunching. Psionics play a big role in the game, and are the major powers available to both the heroes and villains. We use the rules from the Complete Psionics Handbook and the Dark Sun supplement The Will and The Way.

## The Site

This site is updated on my [Apple](http://www.apple.com) Power Macintosh G3/300 using the following products:

  * BBEdit 5.0
  * Microsoft Word 5.1a (The last **real** version...)
  * An ancient copy of Aldus SuperPaint 2.0
  * HTML Colors
  * RTF to HTML for Mac (for the initial build)
  * My trusty [Newton](http://www.newton.apple.com) MessagePad 2100! With NetHopper Browser.

BTW, I'm also the Webmaster, so let me know what you think of the site, too! :-)
