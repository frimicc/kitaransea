Esteemed Sir:
</P>
<P>
This is no doubt a missive you never expected to receive. I hope it finds you in beneficial circumstance. Since taking leave of your house, my road has granted me insight, which, as a child in your care, I certainly seemed to be lacking. I am certain that word has already reached your office of my appointment within the ranks of King Hrethrew's Beogaran force. My position as ambassador and trusted spokesman has been hard-earned. I am well aware that you are no stranger to the game of politics, and as such understand that no mere fool could easily gain the ear of their Liege. And, I assure you, I have earned my position thoroughly through bloodshed and triumph both. I no longer bear the naivet&eacute; of youth. I have become a force unto myself and a highly seen and regarded figure amongst many influential circles. I write this now, not because I desire any undue recompense for past injustice, nor in hopes of some ephemeral acceptance and mending of past wounds between us, but to re-establish ties to a noble and influential family line. A line that most assuredly need not have a sordid past to run through the political muck of our times. I stand proven, accepted and capable of offering our family a valuable asset in both power and politics.
</P>
<P>
Let me make clear that I in no way offer up my Liege or position to you or Ket. My loyalties must, for the time being, lie with my chosen position. However, my heart will always lie with Ket, and you would be wise to consider that. I realize that our personal differences may never be reconciled satisfactorily, however our ties of blood will not be erased, nor put lightly aside. We must instead consider our name and how we can best serve it before we consider our own petty quarrels. Therefore, I urge you to consider a meeting concerning my re-instatement in our house. For our position, as well as the Dasus' future holdings, you deserve to do no less.
</P>
<P>
Yours in trust,

<H2>Letter to Faustus (Planting 4, 1900)</H2>
<P>
Faustus:
</P>
<P>
They've all left now. Only I and the shadows remain. Perhaps one of them has my name written upon it. The febrile light of the fire has long since burned out, but I fancy I can see the stain of the victory pyres inked across the horizon. I am granted cold comfort knowing that your unwavering hand would likely be the catalyst to the flame.
</P>
<P>
Yes. Bane's Temple outside Gothos is alight. The wind carries the tormented screams of the dying and the damned over the city walls and down into the Beogaran camps where I wait. A monstrous symphony indeed. Are they blind to what they have done here? I cannot begin to impress upon you the implications of this action. Does Hrethrew really believe that the Emperor will take this insult as casual? The Ketite forces are almost upon us and if we face them in battle, the outcome is certain. The Dark Master becomes yet another piece we lose to the folly of an inexperienced player.
</P>
<P>
And yet -- None of these forces compare to the real horror unleashed here tonight: The Knights of the Mind. The newest elite force on the side of King Hrethrew march proudly about our camp sporting armbands and proclaiming their psionic prowess. Perhaps you alone will understand when I say, neigh, implore, that the use of psionics as an open political tool must be stopped. These minds have no notion of the weapon they are releasing upon civilization. I never thought to say this, but seeing wormholes opening in the sky to rain molten destruction down upon uncounted souls whilst blooded troops wait at their backs like hounds for the spoils causes my very being to shudder in terror. We have given a weapon of mass destruction to children as a plaything. What can we expect but a repeat of our casually thrown off history? I beg of you, if you have any authority in your god's institution -- MAKE THEM SEE REASON!! Urge them to re-affirm their stand against psionic activity. Perhaps Tyr's voice will make our leaders see reason. If we don't disband these militant psionicists now... I fear it may already be too late.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow I shall pen a second and more difficult letter, to my father. I hold no undue hope for his ties of kinship. I simply pray time has tempered his prejudice against me where anger fueled it in the past. Morning approaches and weariness claws at my guts. I pray sleep will prove a ready bed-fellow.
</P>
<P>
May Tyr guide and keep you.<BR>
Yours in need.

<P>
Dearest Faustus:
</P>
<P>
I trust that you are well. News of your possible work in the South has reached my ears, but I shan't seek you out until I hear from you directly. In some strange way, I believe your absence is giving me strength. I find a great weight lifted from my shoulders as I pen these words and events each week to you. It appears that Ket is seeking to redress the wrongs Beogar forced upon it. News of an invasion force breaching the Granos mountains has just recently infected Alhwick with a renewed sense of purpose. In truth, I hope that the Ketite command never strives to extend this far south. However, in view of past events, I fear the worst. I believe the war is far from over... in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
The Knights of the Mind have, far from being disbanded, become commonplace in the town, with open support of their psionic potential becoming widespread among the people here. Skeeve is touted as a hero, and they sing songs of praise to him recalling the sacking of the great temple outside Gothos. Fortunately he is never mentioned directly in this farce, but still, I fear it will come back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
One note of good fortune: I have recently secured a new mount. Dhak, as he calls himself, is really quite extraordinary. Perhaps I should just come right out and tell you... Dhak is, or more correctly was, an ancient red dragon. Don't be alarmed, however. We destroyed the mind of the true dragon and filled his physical body with a tamed mouse's mind. A docile, useful and intimidating steed to be sure. Although, I must confess, up to this point flying has been a bit of a sore subject. It seems I will have to teach the mouse to fly in the new body. Quite a task, I assure you. Also, he eats a fair enormous amount (and not just cheese)... and finding a proper stable...
</P>
<P>
In all seriousness, I don't know how long I'll be able to enjoy his company. Besides innate prejudice by the common people, another more serious issue has arisen. In the face of war, my father has recalled me to Ket. Don't think for a moment that I will prove a traitor to you or the others! I do, however, feel it necessary to attend my familial obligations and mend past wrongs where I may. I can't fight two wars at once. At least not with any hope of winning. Tomorrow Dhak and I leave for Gothos. If all goes well I shall write Godsday next. If not, pray for my condition.
</P>
<P>
I have enclosed a small token from Dhak's hoard. I know that you do not favor wealth or undue adornment. However I should like you to receive this knowing I, indeed all of us, remembered you and the times we were together. Give it to the church if it pleases you. Just remember from whence it came.
</P>
<P>
You are always in my thoughts,

My Good Sir:
</P>
<P>
I am quite certain that you are aware of the writers of this missive. However, in case I'm somehow mistaken, allow me to enlighten you. I, Zachary Iphicles Dasus of House Dasus of Ket, and several of my companions have recently discovered ourselves to be at the more unfortunate end of several of your personal quarrels with others - most notable of said instances being a very large and cumbersome rock which has completely engulfed the living quarters and shopfront belonging to my companions and I. While we don't begrudge you your quarrels and their resolutions - in a case like this, we, the innocent bystanders, have been left with the awkward job of having to clean up someone else's mess. We are entirely sure that once this matter is brought to your attention you will make full efforts to alleviate any discomfiture caused and reimburse myself and my companions for the aformentioned destruction of property forthwith. In the interest of expediency, you may leave said funds (let us say in the range of 100 gold sovereigns) in Gothos at the house of Lucius Dasus, care of Iphicles. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

<P>
<B>Father:</B> Please send me word if the funds mentioned in the attached letter arrive and I will be by promptly to pick them up. I'm not entirely sure of your views on Costanza, but I feel that this time he has definitely gone too far! I'm hoping to secure an interview with Our Imperial Majesty regarding this and other matters. I have sent a request through the proper channels, but perhaps you might help direct it on its course. I'm quite sure that any aid Ket might need in regards to this man, I would be qualified to offer, and I'm also sure that any information gained for myself and Ket in this matter would only serve to put everyone on our side in a stronger position.

Your Imperial Majesty:

I, your humble servant, Iphicles Dasus do hereby request an audience with your great presence at the soonest appointment available to your convenience. Several grave matters of State have of late been brought to my strictest attention, including, but not limited to, the activities of one Costanza of Wayland. I am seriously concerned with the terrible position of strength he is attempting to amass, and would beg that you consider a meeting wherein I might expound upon the facts at hand at length. I remind you that I am Ket's servant in all things, and if there were some way I could be of use in this matter, I would feel greatly honored.
