The following are a selection of the documents discovered by our heroes while
researching the ancient (and thought long dead) Autarch "Costanza". All of these
works can be found in the Great Elven Library in the Telos Mountains.

In the Year of the Stuck Pig, Costanza declared himself Autarch over the lands
to the south and west of the Ruander Sea. He had effectively controlled the
area for several years, but during the Month of the Stinging Flea, he held a
coronation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
His power had started small -- first, in the Year of the Radiant Blossom, he
became the leader of his tribe: the Kil'aran. They then conquered the
neighboring tribes over the course of the next five years. As each tribal
leader was brought before him, he performed the Ceremony of Dutifulness.
Thereafter, each tribal leader became his most devout supporters. Costanza was
worshipped by several thousand people by the time he declared himself
Autarch.
</P>
<P>
His rule lasted only four years, until he disappeared. During those four years
he had his most skilled craftsmen build a tomb for him -- a tomb with no doors
or windows. Upon its completion, Costanza had all the builders sacrificed in a
huge ceremony. Then he announced that he would leave his people forever. He
would become Immortal. Then he disappeared.
</P>
<P>
His representatives in each tribe suddenly became fitful and restless. They no
longer worshipped him. The tribes fell to warring with one another until the
region was reunited under the Autarch Soloman in the Year of the Trained Rat.

took the title Autarch in 3996. Vanished without a trace, leaving the region in
disarray in 3999. Rumors declared him dead, but others claimed he had instead
traveled somewhere.

We visited the Port of Constance this week, 3/21/17, and it is a changed place.
People in the street are edgy, distracted. Several shops were closed and we
could not find a place to drink. Most people did not want to answer our
questions, but one old man said that he had nothing left to live for anyways:
Costanza took over our town a few weeks ago, he said. Since then he has had
"meetings" (he said this with exagerated emphasis) with all of our leaders.
They've returned changed, he said. They went in under guard, dragged kicking
and screaming, but they came out smiling and telling everyone that there was
nothing to fear from this nice man. "Costanza is our ruler now, and we must
help him." they said. Now we have to give up half of our livelyhood in tribute
and anyone who speaks against it goes in for a "meeting". (again, the emphasis.
I think he doesn't mean any ordinary meeting here, but it may be a euphemism
for something else.) In any case, when we returned to the ship, we found it
empty -- the dockmen had unloaded it all as tribute to the Autarch. Our captain
decided not to argue, but we set sail that night and told everyone we knew not
to go to Constance anymore.

Dictionary of Common Terms (in Dwarvish)

<P>
<B>Autarch</B>: <I>noun, pronounced "AWE-tark".</I> First heard in the 2,013th year after the
fall of the sky, this new term is a kind of King. The Humans around the smaller
water have had their kings change their title to Autarch, for some reason.
Explanations given have been conflicting: Some say that it means that they are
more powerful than Kings, and needed a more powerful-sounding name. Others say
that it means that they are not only kings but masters of the Mind, what used
to be called "Mindbenders" in Common (c.f.). Still others say that it means
nothing more than that the rich and powerful get to collect more taxes. Regions
ruled by an Autarch tend to be extremely lawful and have little crime or
poverty. All men have work. However, they do not tend to be friendly to
outsiders, so care must be taken when visiting these realms.

The Life and Times of Costanza, a dramatization
</H2>
<P>
[Many, many pages of obviously fictional fluff, making him out to be the
saviour of the world. He walks on water, reads minds, heals the sick, kills the
criminals (who don't like him and attack him), and becomes a great leader
because people in towns rife with strife ask him to "free them from the tyrrany
of poverty and crime". However, one scene is marked out in the manuscript with
a big red "X".]

<I>Vizier:</I> But how, your eminence? We have only a few men who we know are loyal
and they are known by the criminals. We can only detect new criminals now that
we are known here.
</P>
<P>
<I>Costanza:</I> No, we have other methods. Bring some of the criminals to me. I will
change them... convince them to work for us, to turn in their comrades. Once
they have seen the truth about me, they will willingly serve me, as you do.

<P>
<I>Vizier:</I> (in stilted, robotico tones) Yes, master. They will serve you as I
do.

Diary of Autarch Tuvariss, ruler of the tribes of Tunwalch
</H2>
<P>
<B>5/67/15 --</B> Today I met with the new Autarch of Ruadar, a man named Costanza. He
is of medium build, about my height with black hair and a great beard. He
proposed that our kingdoms unite, with me as the combined ruler. "What do you
get from this," I asked him outright, since the plan seemed to leave him
nothing. "Only this," he said after a moment, "Let me rule for four years.
After that time, I will be gone and you will be the sole ruler of this land."
Well, I could hardly believe him, so I questioned him further, "Why? Do you
think you will be killed within a few years?" "No," he answered. "I hope not."
He smiled, an eerie thing that made me think he was mad. "I believe that within
ten years all that we Autarchs have built will begin to crumble." I laughed
aloud at his prediction of doom. "You can't be serious?" I said, "We now
control almost half of the Seashore, and the entire Ruander Sea. And none of us
is old -- without assassins, whom we controlled first, we should all still be
ruling a century from now." I laughed again. "You give these upstart
elf-friends too much credit." He turned away from me for a moment, and then
smiled again. "We shall see." Since I could not determine what his gain would
be, I did not accept his offer.

<B>3/32/18 --</B> I heard news today from some of my spies in Constance that Costanza
has started building himself a tomb. What an insane man! How can he not believe
that we shall control the whole earth? We have already taken the limits: it is
said that an Empire has been built north of the Grand Mountains, by Kethan. If
we can even build empires, controlling thousands of people with our reach, how
can we be stopped? I think I'll recall my spies from Constance -- this man is
no threat to me or anyone but himself.

<B>Third month, second week of 5530:</B>
</P>
<P>
We came to the battleground of Selenish, to find what treasure was available.
We found less than we had hoped: there were few bodies to loot, and even fewer
available weapons. The townsfolk told us that the battle was a success
--&nbsp;the troops of Balak kept falling on the Autarch's forces like waves
against the shore. As they were cut down, they sprung up again to continue the
fight. This bothers us. It seems that the mages of the humans have started
summoning their own troops as undead. If this starts a trend, which it most
likely will, we will soon see more of the evil scourge of the living spread
across the earth. We must investigate this further, and inform the council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we also discovered a long forgotten tomb. Alyssa, the mindbender,
declared that it was the tomb of an Autarch Costanza, buried for 2000 years
until he returns to claim what is his. She contacted her teacher, who did some
research and informed us that this tomb would be closed for a while longer,
according to the message. It seems that it was closed around 4000. We searched
for a way in to get the treasure, but to no avail. She couldn't enter through
any dimensions and Galrarn couldn't even magically enter. The place has no
openings, being a solid sphere of metal and stone. The spells and mental fields
protecting it have no equals. We marked it on the list as "To Come Back Later",
but I doubt anyone will get into it until it wants to be opened.

I'm going to use normal dates, since the elf died. Still, he thought it was
pretty important to keep this journal of our travels, so we might as well do
it. Since I'm the only one who can write right, I get the job.

After our fight with the Hill Giants, we now number four: Me, Slathos, a Ketite
Invoker; our leader, Krill, a fighter from the Gorgon river in the south;
Regulon, the thief from Gothos; and Little Bill, the halfling "jack of all
trades" as he styles himself. Unfortunately we lost our Enchanter, Filliran,
the elf who kept this journal previously, and Gorvaer, the other fighter. So,
anyway,

We came across this old tomb buried in the hills outside Selenica. It has the
name "Costanza" emblazoned on the front door. Well, we think it's the front
door. A small cave leads back into a chamber with an archway. The Archway says
"Constanza lies here. Disturb not his body." Of course, we all know that that
doesn't work with us adventurer types, so we tried to get in. The place has a
powerful Anti-magic shell of some kind around it, so we couldn't use Dig or
Move Earth or even Heat Metal to fracture some of the joints in the thing. From
our digging, it looks to be a sphere, buried about 20 feet under ground and
about 80 feet in diameter. See the drawings. Pretty small for a tomb,
especially one without any visible entrance. However, we did manage to get
close enough to dig into the sides with a regular shovel. (And the rest of us
always chided Bill for carrying around "normal" equipment! We feel bad about
that now.) We managed to pop out one of the stones and found more metal inside
it. However, there was a symbol on the stone, a yellow eye with fire around it,
on the inside side of the stone. The metal that was behind it had the same
symbol, only on the outside. It looks as if some great heat in the past
transferred the image from the stone to the metal or vice versa. We pulled out
a couple of more stones and found the same thing on each one. I wonder what
happened to the sphere that it could have gotten so hot --&nbsp;with the
anti-magic shell around it, it must have been something really spectactular and
either high-level magic or non-magical.

We flew to Gothos and started researching what we could in the library there.
We found one really interesting fact about this "Costanza". He turns out to
have been a minor Autarch, a couple thousand years ago, who only ruled for five
years before "vanishing" into his tomb. He must have set up the precautions
from the inside, so that he could teleport into it and then protect himself. He
killed all the people who worked on it. However, in the "Book of Dead Rulers",
by Lionel Rampart, (1435, I think) it says that he was always afraid of spiders
and insects. His tomb is so solid, so that nothing, not even a worm, could get
into it to disturb his body. It also said that he was a much nicer ruler than
many other Autarchs, only killing those who vocally disagreed with him instead
of using his mind-witch powers to kill those who thought about disagreeing with
him. Nice. I'm glad we don't have his kind of ruler around today -- even the
Emperor of Ket isn't that bad. Anyway, we have decided to give up on his tomb.
It's too impregnable, and since he was such a minor ruler, he probably didn't
have that much treasure. Instead, we are going to go into the Beogar side of
the Granos Mountains, looking for that huge ruby we heard about in Telandyr. I
hope the map that guy sold us is right!
