Making Queries for Keyword Searches
</H2>
Just type in the word you're searching for. If you want to search for more than
one word, then you have to decide whether you're looking for documents that 
have <STRONG>all</STRONG> of those words (AND mode), or documents that have 
<STRONG>any</STRONG> of those words (OR mode).
<P>
The default mode is AND. Just type in the words separated by spaces.
<P>
To search in OR mode, separate the words you're looking for with " or ". For 
example, to look for documents about any of your favorite fruits, type 
<P>
<CODE>mango or banana or Dole</CODE> 
<P>
into the box.
<P>
You can't combine AND and OR modes. If you're trying to search for a 
multiword phrase, then you need to do a concept-based search instead.

Making Queries for Concept-Based Searches
</H2>
Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.
<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H3>Query Basics</H3>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean systems
that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the words in your
query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a best match
for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes, so
sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your information need
-- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about providing too many words;
the more words, the better. Additional words in your query will help Excite for
Web Servers figure out what concepts you're really interested in. On the other
hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty good job of figuring out what
documents are interesting to you even if your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>
If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
of the Widget2000
</PRE>
Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.

<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H3>Advanced Query Tips</H3>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B><DD>
If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers
considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be part of your
information need, so queries like the previous example will find all
documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000, which
may not be exactly what you want.
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and un-hyphenated words. So,
sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say that you want both
versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers will try to figure
out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and <CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to
explicitly specify multiple forms.
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>, <I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.
Consequently, those words in your query will be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also
ignores numbers; however, it can find strings that happen to contain a
number, for example <I>3Com</I>.
