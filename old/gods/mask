<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>The adventuring cleric of Mask dresses like any other armored cleric. The specialty
priest of Mask usually dresses as a thief (that is, like almost anyone who might
be met on the street). Ceremonial garb is much more impressive. The tunic and trousers
are a bright motley, with ballooned sleeves and cuffs. The entire ensemble is covered
by a gray cloak that can be bundled shut, concealing the brightness beneath. The
cloak has a hood and the priests of Mask (standard or specialty) wear black cloth
masks beneath.</P>
<P>In areas where thieves are tolerated and worship of Mask is fairly open, these
masks are of a sheer fabric, while in most of the North they are a thick wool to
hide identities. There is a saying that, &quot;the degree of law in a town can be
seen on the face of a cleric of Mask:'</P>
<P>The priesthood of Mask is independent in each major city or region, to prevent
the frequent actions against one thieves' guild or temple from spilling over and
affecting others. The hierarchy makes use of clerics, specialty priests, and thieves
in about a 40/30/30 ratio.</P>
<P>In areas with a single strong thieves' guild, the temple or shrine to Mask is
usually connected to the guild hall via underground tunnels. In large cities with
competing guilds, the temple is in an underground location and is recognized as neutral
ground by all sides.</P>
<P>Specialty priests of Mask are called demarchs if male, demarchesses if female.
