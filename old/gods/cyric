<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Cyric may command undead as do clerics, but do so as if
they were two levels higher.
<LI>Specialty priests of Cyric are immune to fear and other emotion-altering magic.
They can still be charmed and are subject to enchantment/charm magic, provided that
the spells have no effect on the emotions.
<LI>Specialty priests of Cyric at 5th level can summon an aerial servant (as per
the spell). This servant will fight for the priest and can act as a magical assassin.
</UL>
<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Cyric is the youngest of the gods and potentially one of the most powerful, having
a huge horde of followers and worshipers.</P>
<P>Due to his relative youth as a deity, Cyric has very few original followers of
his own, though this is changing. Those assassins' guilds are enthusiastic supporters,
having been swayed by the arguments of the temples of Cyric.</P>
<P>The &quot;true priests&quot; of Cyric dress simply in black or dark purple robes
with hoods. All wear silver bracers on their wrists as a symbol of enslavement to
their god. While the Banite custom of facial tattoos is ignored, priests of Cyric
paint the symbol of their new god on their cheeks and/ or forehead on high holy days.</P>
<P>As an evil god, Cyric's temples and shrines are openly tolerated only in the most
evil or most tolerant of cities. And the other evil gods (Talos, Malar, Shar) are
carefully watching this young upstart to see if he succeeds in commanding his godhood
or stumbles. If Cyric stumbles, the other gods will certainly be there to pick up
the pieces and rob the bodies.
