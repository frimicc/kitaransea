<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<P>Cults tend to vary greatly from one area to another, as different individuals
seek to tie into the same natural or supernatural power. They also tend to be much
weaker than the mainline clerics. </P>
<P>Typical Elemental Cult Powers are shown on this page.</P>
<UL>
<LI>At 5th level, the priest may summon an elemental of the particular type once
per day. That elemental is under the priest's control for one hour, and then it fades
away.
</UL>
<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Ceremonies, alignments, and ethoi of the various elemental cults vary from cult
to cult. Ceremonial dress varies as well, though they tend to tailor themselves along
the lines of the gods whom they mimic.</P>
<P>Followers of <B>Grumbar</B> choose large, bulky vestments with heavy padding to
bulk up their mortal frames. They normally choose earth tones, blacks, and grays.</P>
<P>Followers of <B>Akadi</B> choose light, sheer robes in myriad blues and pastel
yellows.</P>
<P>Followers of <B>Kossuth</B> prefer robes and long capes in reds, yellows, and
oranges.</P>
<P>Followers of <B>Istishia</B> prefer flowing robes and capes in deep blues, greens,
and purples.</P>
<P>Most cults are secretive and usually are formed for other purposes than advancing
the ethos of their &quot;god:' The various elemental lords are unfeeling toward their
followers and probably do not gain any power from their existence.
