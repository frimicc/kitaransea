Granted Powers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>
Specialty priests of Leira may use certain types of wizard spells from
scrolls without using a &lt;read magic&gt; spell to comprehend them. Spells which are
purely illusion/phantasm spells may be used in this fashion. Any spell which uses illusion/phantasm magic in conjunction with other magic schools cannot be used.
If a scroll contains illusion/phantasm spells with those of other schools, then
only the illusion/phantasm spells may be used.</LI>
<LI>
At 5th level, a specialty priest of Leira can cast a &lt;misdirection&gt;
spell (2nd-level wizard spell) once per day. The priest may cast another misdirection for
every additional five levels.</LI>
<LI>
At 13th level, a specialty priest of Leira can cast a &lt;mislead&gt;
spell once per day.</LI>
<LI>
One spell is completely forbidden to both clerics and specialty priests
of Leira--&lt;true seeing&gt; or devices that use &lt;true seeing&gt;. Any priest
of Leira who uses this spell goes irrevocably insane. There is no penalty for casting the reverse
of this spell, &lt;false detection&gt;.</LI>

Other Notes</H3>
<P>
The church of Leira has large numbers of clerics, specialty priests, and
illusionists in its organization. Exact numbers are unknown because members of the faith cheerfully lie about its tenets, organization, numbers, and powers. Relations
between the various followers in the hierarchy are good, mainly because no one knows
fully what is going on.
</P>
<P>
Making matters worse is the fact that all of the church hierarchy dress in
the same manner--long, cowled robes with a smooth, silvered globe worn as a mask. The
mask runs down to the chin, but bulges out so the priest can still breathe and speak
normally. The mask is made of silvered glass so the wearer can see normally, though everything looks rather dim.
</P>
<P>
The silvered mask will reflect gaze attacks from creature whose attacks can
be reflected by mirrors, though the priest can still see the creature and be
affected; the priest gains a +3 bonus on saving throws vs. gaze weapons. Vampires, who hate mirrors, seek to slay Leiran priests whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
The color of the orb depends on a number of factors, including the time of
day (red is used for morning, blue for afternoon, rust for dusk, and gray for night).
</P>
<P>
Leiran priests are called whatever they choose to be called, and official
titles vary from day to day and from person to person. Pompous titles are often followed
by misleading ones (this week's high pontiff is next week's acolyte).
</P>
<P>
Given their tendencies to prevaricate, priests and devoted followers of
Leira are at best tolerated, but usually mistrusted. However, Lord Khelben of C&aelig;lwynn
is said to hire Leirans exclusively to staff the Beogaran Bureau of Adventurer Information.
</P>
<P>
A sure sign that a Leiran priest trusts you is not that he does not lie, but
that his lies are obvious lies; huge tales without a shred of plausibility.
