<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Tyr may turn undead as clerics. They may also command the
undead to perform tasks, such as guarding a passageway, without endangering their
alignment.
<LI>Henchmen following a specialty priest of Tyr treat that priest as if his Charisma
was 18 for purposes of determining loyalty, provided that those henchmen worship
(or at least recognize the power of) Tyr.
<LI>The duration of divination and protection spells is doubled when the spell is
cast by a specialty priest of Tyr. Of course, a permanent spell is still permanent.
<LI>Followers of Tyr may use the &lt;command&gt; spell once per day, at will.
<LI>Specialty priests of Tyr may Detect Lie twice per day, at will.
</UL>
<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Like the followers of Tempus, the ceremonial costume of Tyr is the same in the
field as in the temple--a full suit of battle armor with an ornate helm. But while
the church of Tempus prefers its ceremonial armor dented, battle-scarred, and bloodied,
the church of Tyr keeps its armor in well-polished shape.</P>
<P>Rank within the church hierarchy is shown by the color tints of the armor--rich,
church-approved shaded inks rubbed into the metal itself. The lowest rank has a bloodstained
red similar to that of Tempurans, then rising (according to the local customs) to
sunrise orange, harvest yellow, dragon green, and a sky blue for the patriarchs of
the faith. The greatest heroes of Tyr are entitled to have a dusky purple polish
rubbed onto their armor.</P>
<P>Specialty priests of Tyr are called Lawgivers. It is the duty of a Lawgiver (or
cleric of Tyr) to preside as judge at any trial when asked to do so by the parties
involved. In rural areas, travelling Lawgivers may be the entire justice system for
the local authorities.</P>
<P>All priests and clerics of Tyr must always keep their word. If a cleric or priest
breaks an oath, he must immediately report to the nearest temple and confess his
actions to the high priest. The high priest will then choose a punishment, usually
involving meditation and sacrifice, but sometimes for great misdeeds a quest, which
the priest must perform. Until the penance is completed, the cleric or priest will
not be able to use any granted abilties or any spells greater than third level.
