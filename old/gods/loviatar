Specialty priests of Loviatar cannot turn or command undead.
</LI>
<LI>
Specialty priests of Loviatar may inflict a &lt;pain touch&gt; on their
opponents. The recipient is allowed a saving throw vs. spells. If this throw succeeds, he
suffers no effect. If the target fails the saving throw, he is wracked by pain, suffering
-4 penalties to attack rolls and -2 to all Dexterity checks for as many rounds as
the priest's level. The priest may attack one individual of size H or smaller each
day for every three levels of experience (one person at levels 1-3, two at levels 4-6,
etc.).

<LI>
Individuals who have brought great pain and suffering to others
sometimes receive a boon from the goddess in the form of a white wand. This white wand is
a magical item that may only be used by the one it was given to. If anyone else
touches the wand it dissolves like ice melting in the sun. The wand absorbs hostile
spell energy sent against the holder, sucking up 1-10 levels of spells before being
used up and dissolving. A spell which is partially absorbed is totally spoiled (a
3rd-level &lt;fireball&gt; cast against a priest with a white wand that can absorb only
two more spell levels will still fail). Loviatar usually grants these boons to priests
(specialty priests and clerics) who have caused extreme suffering in her name. However,
she has been know to grant such wands to individuals outside her faith who have, willingly or not, caused widespread suffering. She prefers to grant them to
those who have unwillingly or unknowingly done so, in particular good and lawful types
who will be tormented just knowing that they have advanced her cause.

Other Notes</H3>
<P>
Priests and priestesses of Loviatar wear a pleated armor that resembles
scale mail, both when adventuring and during ceremonies. However, the ceremonial garb is light-weight, designed for fashion rather than protection. The AC of ceremonial
scale mail is 6 instead of 4.
</P>
<P>
Loviatar maintains a small but tightly organized clergy composed primarily
of clerics. Her specialty priests, called pains, operate as a separate arm of the
faith, moving from place to place and ensuring that the goddess's will is carried out.
The clerics hold the pains in great regard, since they are often the tools of
Loviatar's punishment. If an organized temple or shrine of Loviatar is present in a city,
clerics make up the bulk of the organization, but 1-3 pains will also be available.
