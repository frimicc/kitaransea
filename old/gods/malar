<LI>
Specialty priests of Malar cannot command or turn undead.
</LI>
<LI>
Specialty priests of Malar have the hunting proficiency automatically with
a +2 bonus. Additional slots allotted to this proficiency increase it normally.
</LI>
<LI>
Specialty priests of Malar may use the &lt;claws of Malar&gt;. These are
acquired through the church and are not normally for sale on the open market. They are claw-like devices similar to brass knuckles, but with sharp, jagged edges along
the top like lion's claws. The claws weigh 1 lb. each, are size S, do type S
damage, with a speed factor of 2. They inflict ld6 damage to S/M targets and ld4 to L or
larger targets. The priest of Malar can attack twice per round, once with each hand,
using these weapons without disadvantage. The priest must allocate a weapon
proficiency for these weapons in order to use them. Other individuals can try to use the
claws, but a nonbeliever or nonpriest of Malar will suffer the wrath of the church if
he does so. (Said wrath translates to the priests hunting down and slaying the
individual as a warning to others.)
</LI>
<LI>
At 3rd level, priests of Malar can identify plants, animals, and pure
water with 98 % accuracy.
</LI>
<LI>
At 7th level, priests of Malar are immune to the effects of &lt;charm&gt;
spells cast by woodland creatures, in a fashion similar to druids.

Other Notes</H3>
<P>
The "church" of Malar has no real organization. Rather it is built around
the concept of the hunt. The most powerful individual in the group is the
huntmaster and he rules the followers. It is the huntmaster who decides the time of the
ceremonial hunts, the type of prey, and the location of the ceremonial hunt. The
huntmaster may be a cleric, specialty priest, or even a fighter, wizard, or rogue. The
huntmaster may be challenged at any time by others. He may resign to the challenger or (more
likely) battle to the death.
</P>
<P>
Specialty priests of Malar are normally dressed in woodland gear, usually
red and brown in color. The headpiece is always that of a great bear, cat, wolf, or
other predator, preferably one that the priest slew himself with either his bare
hands or his claws.
</P>
<P>
The weapon known as the claws of Malar is considered the sole property of
then followers of Malar. Nonbelievers use the claws at their own risk, as the
followers of Malar will target that individual as the subject for their next hunt.
</P>
<P>
Malar is not a popular god with many devoted followers. Like the Elemental
Lords, he is invoked usually to prevent his intercession (usually heralded by wild beasts)
as opposed to beseeching it. There do exist groups devoted to following him and
these bands terrorize civilized areas poaching for what they need.
</P>
<P>
Priests of Malar will seek out and attempt to destroy druids, regardless of
the faith that the druid professes. Because druids fight to maintain a balance, they are
the antithesis of the single-minded Malarites. Druid and bardic organizations also
try to seek out and destroy Malar strongholds.
