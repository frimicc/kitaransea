<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Waukeen can command and turn undead as clerics.
<LI>Specialty priests of Waukeen have the appraising and gem cutting proficiencies
at no cost. These can be improved normally.
<LI>Specialty priests of Waukeen have the ability to discern true metal from false.
They cannot identify metal per se, but can determine if a supposedly gold coin is
truly gold or a gold-plated lead fake, or even if it was created magically (say,
by a djinn). They do this by hefting the item in the hand and thinking of what the
material should be. For mixtures they will get a &quot;partial&quot; result for those
metals which are a significant component of the alloy.
</UL>
<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>The ceremonial garb of Waukeen's followers are gaudy, ornate, and overdone. A
heavy, baroque cloak loaded with plates and wheels of different precious metals covers
rich tunics, tabards, and trousers of fine material in vibrant colors. The high priest
of the local temple carries a magical staff also decorated with precious metals and
gems. These staffs are usually &lt;staffs of curing&gt;, but can be of other varieties.</P>
<P>Moneylending is one of the ways the church of Waukeen stays prosperous. Temples
usually have a sizeable amount of money available to lend to merchants and other
followers of Waukeen at reasonable interest rates. The priests take this business
very seriously, though, and protect their interests well. Woe to he who skips town
instead of paying his loan from Waukeen!
