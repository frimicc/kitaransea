<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Selune may turn undead, as can their clerical counterparts.
<LI>Specialty priests of Selune are gifted with infravision (30-foot range).
<LI>Specialty priests of Selune have the navigation proficiency at start. This does
not occupy an initial proficiency slot and can be increased in the normal fashion.
<LI>Specialty priests are not immune to lycanthropy. If infected by a lycanthrope,
however, and that lycanthrope's alignment is the same as the infected priest's (or
the priest changes alignment to match the lycanthrope, with all attendant penalties),
then the specialty priest can control the transformations at will, as a natural (rather
than infected) lycanthrope.

<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>As befits her changeable and chaotic nature, the hierarchy and even ceremonial
costume of the Selunites vary from place to place. They run from simple hermitages
and plain brown robes to opulent temples and rich pageantry. The finest can be found
at the House of the Moon in Gothos, where the high priestess Naneatha Suaril presides
in a wide-bottomed skirt hooped with whalebone and set with pearls, with a large
fan-like collar rising at the back of the neck, again stiffened with whalebone and
set with precious stones. A great deal of moon-related activity occurs in and around
Gothos, and most of this is attributed to the temple to Our Lady of Silver.</P>
<P>Most Selunites, however, tend toward smaller shrines and individual worship, since
&quot;Anywhere the full moon shines is the place for Selune.&quot; The goddess is
reputed to be free with her gifts and boons to mortals, mostly through a group of
shining female servitors known as Shards.</P>
<P>Reflecting the chaotic and scattered nature of the church of Selune, its hierarchy
is a hodgepodge of clerics, specialty priests, informed or blessed lay individuals,
and a smattering of good-aligned lycanthropes (natural and infected). All cooperate
in relative (if rollicking) peace under the moon symbol.
