<LI>Mielikki's specialty clerics are rangers, as described on page 28 of the &lt;Player's
Handbook&gt;.
</UL>
<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Most rangers venerate Mielikki as their deity and she grants the bulk of their
spells when they attain sufficient level. As a result the ranger player character
class and the priests of Mielikki tend to work closely together.</P>
<P>The organized church hierarchy of Mielikki is almost exclusively clerics, with
rangers in direct service to the church regarded as an adventuring arm or a tool
to be used against marauders and followers of Malar. While Mielikki has no druids
within her faith, relations between her churchmen and druids are good.</P>
<P>Ceremonial dress of the followers of Mielikki is a simple tabard and trousers
with a short cape. The shirt is usually short-sleeved, but long-sleeved in winter.
The symbol of Mielikki is worn over the heart.</P>
<P>The colors of the ceremonial garb vary with the seasons, each season having a
base color and an accent. Winter is white with green accents, spring green with yellow
accents, summer yellow with red accents, and fall red with white accents.</P>
<P>Adventuring priests of Mielikki and rangers in direct service of the goddess dress
like clerics in times of war, but try to keep their colors constant with the time
of year.
