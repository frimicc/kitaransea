<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Talos may turn and command undead the same as clerics.
<LI>At 7th level, the specialty priests of Talos may cast a &lt;lightning bolt&gt;
(Wiz 7), once per day. They may not cast the lightning bolt if they are wearing any
armor. (If the priest were wearing metal armor, the lightning would arc back and
strike her!) They gain an additional lightning bolt for every three levels of experience
(another at 10th, a third at 13th, etc.).
<LI>At 10th level, the priest may control weather once per day. The priest may move
the conditions to any worse condition under the same prevailing heading (as per the
spell description and the chart on page 232 of the &lt;Player's Handbook&gt;). Priests
may never use their abilities to improve the weather condition (as that would not
be in the best interest of their god).
</UL>
<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Talos's name is invoked by individuals who wish to escape his attention, not draw
it. There are a few direct followers of his who support (and encourage) his storms.
These followers are almost always led by a specialty priest, who is called a stormlord.
Such groups are small, because if they succeed as an organization, their end result
is to destroy the territory they are in.</P>
<P>The ceremonial garb of the stormlords is black robes shot with jagged yellow streaks.
The robes have jagged hems and rough, uneven sleeves. A black eyepatch is worn, even
if the priest has good vision in both eyes. Unlike the followers of the orc god Gruumsh,
self-mutilation is not a requirement.</P>
<P>In the following of Talos, it is the clerics who are in the minority. They are
usually found only as adventurers and free operatives outside the scattering of church
cells.
