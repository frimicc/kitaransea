<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Bane may not turn or command undead. Clerics who worship
Bane may turn and command undead normally.
<LI>Priests of Bane are unaffected by <B>fear</B> spells, though they may be affected
by other emotion-affecting spells and spell-like abilities.
<LI>Priests of Bane at 5th level may generate an aura of fear, stretching 10 feet
away for every level of the priest. Everything within the area which fails its saving
throw will try to escape the area (70%) or attack the source of their fear (30%--the
DM may modify these chances based on the situation). Those who pass their saving
throw vs. spells or are unable to escape are affected by ill-ease and a great desire
to be somewhere else (no modification to hit or damage dice). This aura of fear can
be created at will, once per day. It lasts one round per level of the caster. It
is often used when questioning suspects or bullying less powerful individuals. Priests
of Bane are immune to this effect.

<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Specialty priests of Bane have a variety of titles within their organization,
depending on location and position. They tend to be grandiose and threatening (high
imperceptor, grand bloodletter, etc.).</P>
<P>Ceremonial dress for Banites is black armor with blood-red capes. The more prosperous
the priest, the finer the workmanship of the armor. Facial tattoos are common among
Banites, which unfortunately makes them stand out in cities. High-level officers
in the hierarchy wear gems on their foreheads.</P>
<P>When adventuring, priests of Bane retain the black armor. Wizards who follow Bane
prefer long, flowing, black and red robes. Neither group would wear such gear if
it would expose them to persecution or hamper their service to their god. Usually,
extensive facial tattoos among Banites is enough to identify them.
