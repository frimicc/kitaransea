<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Sune may turn undead as clerics.
<LI>Specialty priests of Sune may attempt to charm (as the wizard spell) individuals
of the same race and opposite sex. The priest may attempt this charm once per day,
but it if fails (the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spells) he cannot use it
again until he has made proper offerings and meditations at an established shrine
or temple. The victim is penalized one point on his save for every point of Charisma
the priest has above 16 (-1 at 17, -2 at 18).
<LI>Those priests who have earned a great boon from Sune (by completing some great
task in her name) may be gifted with a draught of Evergold, which raises the Charisma
of the individual by 2d4 points for one day. Only priests of Sune may benefit from
this draught--to all others it is poison. Charisma may reach godly levels in this
fashion. Followers and henchmen gained at high Charisma will drift away after the
draught wears off, but initial reactions and the effects of the natural &lt;charm&gt;
spell will remain.
<LI>Should a specialty priest of Sune drop below 16 Charisma, then he is cast out
of the faith until he recovers from the loss. This does not apply to clerics, though
the prejudice within the church hierarchy against those who are marred is very strong.
<LI>Elves and half-elves may become specialty priests of Sune, though these invite
the wrath of Hanali Celanil, the goddess of elven beauty.

<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Sunites are called priests regardless of their status as specialty priests or
clerics. Their leader is a high priest or priestess, regardless of level. Organization
is loose and informal, so a high priestess can easily abdicate her position for adventuring
(or a good party) without creating much scandal in clerical circles.</P>
<P>The standard ceremonial and official garb of Sune priests are monastic robes for
men, habits for women, both cut to show off the figure and dyed a deep crimson. Men
wear a crimson bandanna while women wear a red wimple with a v-shaped forehead piece.
Hair is normally worn long, and while red hair is considered touched by the goddess,
all shades of hair and skin are welcome, provided they are unmarred and lovely.</P>
<P>When fighting or adventuring, clerics of Sune prefer as much protection (magical
and otherwise) as they can afford--not that they are cowards, but they want desperately
to avoid scars or even magical healing.</P>
<P>Other faiths tend to regard Sunites as flighty and vain, but basically harmless.
The Sunites have an intense rivalry with the followers of the Elven goddess Hanali
Celanil. The only other conflict currently stirring the church is which is more beautiful,
the graceful arches of the House of Firehair in Nethathon or the proud towers of
the Temple of Beauty in Gothos.
