<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Shar may command the undead as clerics.
<LI>At 1st level, specialty priests of Shar may cast one &lt;darkness&gt; spell per
day. For each two additional levels (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.) the priest gains the ability
to cast another &lt;darkness&gt; spell that day.
<LI>At 5th level, specialty priests of Shar may cast one &lt;continual darkness&gt;
spell per day. For each five additional levels, the priest gains the ability to cast
another &lt;continual darkness&gt; spell.
<LI>At 7th level, specialty priests of Shar may cast a &lt;forget&gt; spell (as the
wizard spell of the same name) once per day.
<LI>In darkness (even that of their own creation), specialty priests of Shar have
a +1 bonus to hit, damage, and on saving throws. This is not cumulative with other
darkness modifiers, but replaces them.
<LI>In the light of a full moon, specialty priests of Shar have a -1 penalty to hit,
damage, and on saving throws.

<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>The specialty priests of Shar are called nightbringers. They exist outside the
standard church hierarchy. Shar has no main temple, but instead has a scattering
of cells and secretive places throughout the Kitaran Sea area. The nightbringers
of Shar serve as contacts, messengers, and enforcers of the Dark Lady's will.</P>
<P>Ceremonial dress is long-sleeved robes of deep purple, parted in front to reveal
black tights. A black skullcap covers the entire head, except for women with jet-black
hair; this is left long as a symbol of the Dark Lady's pleasure.</P>
<P>One of the reasons for the small numbers of Shar's followers is the hatred held
for Selune and her worshipers. Several local jihads led by Shar fanatics against
more powerful forces (usually Selunites backed up with the aid of several other faiths
and/or clerics of good alignment) have served to keep their numbers down. However,
Shar is a popular human goddess among goblins and other light-hating beings, and
many venerate (without actually worshiping) her when doing business in the dark.
