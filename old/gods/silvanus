<LI>The specialty clerics of Silvanus are druids, with all the abilities noted on
page 35 of the &lt;Player's Handbook&gt;.

<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>The ceremonial dress for both clerics and druids of Silvanus is a suit of armor
made of overlapping leaves. For clerics the leaves are made of metal plates and the
suit functions as a set of scale mail. For druids the leaves are made of green-tinted
leather and the suit functions as leather armor. Either set is worn with green breeches
and shirt. The outfit is topped with a large helm with oak leaf-shaped wings.</P>
<P>In urban areas, where the clerics outnumber the druids, the standard dress has
been simplified to a green-copper pin worn on the breast when not involved with the
High Ceremonies.</P>
<P>When adventuring, druids and clerics of Silvanus may wear their ceremonial armor
or switch to something less flamboyant, depending on their mission.</P>
<P>There are many druids who worship different gods -- Chauntea, Silvanus, and Mielikki.
All these groups maintain their own hierarchy of great druids, grand druids, and
archdruids. Their interfaith relations are fairly cordial, and each will defer to
the others in their areas of expertise (Chauntea for clerics and crops, Mielikki
for forests and rangers, and Silvanus for nature in general and druids). Conflicts
between the faiths are settled through negotiation, or, failing that, ritual or personal
combat.
