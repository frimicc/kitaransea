<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Gond gain a +2 bonus when using the following proficiencies:
armorer, artistic ability, blacksmithing, carpentry, engineering, pottery, and weaponsmithing.
A specialty priest does not gain these proficiencies automatically, but does gain
the +2 base bonus when using them. Additional nonweapon proficiency slots devoted
to these proficiencies increase this modifier normally.
<LI>Specialty clerics of Gond have an aptitude for devices, which includes mechanical
locks. They may pick locks, given proper tools, as a thief of half their level.
<LI>Specialty priests of Gond cannot turn or command undead.
<LI>Gnomes may be priests of Gond. This vocation is frowned on in most gnomish communities,
but the deity is slowly gaining acceptance among these people.

<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Specialty priests of Gond tend to be southerners. There are a number of northern
branches of the faith, including a budding temple complex in Sauter, though most
of the specialty priests of the faith are immigrants from the south.</P>
<P>In most of the region, the proportion of clerics to Gondsmen (as the specialty
priests are called) is 20:1. In the south this proportion is reversed. Many southern
merchants encountered are specialty priests of Gond.</P>
<P>Gondsmen wear saffron vestments with a crimson sash over the right or left shoulder.
The sash is dotted with small metal tools and other objects, which may or may not
prove useful (and range from interesting bits of tin to the Gondsman's lock-picking
set). They wear a metal belt about the waist and enormous sun hats. In dangerous
situations Gondsmen wear standard armor (along with the sash), but generally a Gondsman
prefers the protection of 10 or 12 big fighters.
