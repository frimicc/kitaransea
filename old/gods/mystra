<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Mystra is the goddess of spells themselves, the magical energy that makes all
spell casting possible. Mystran advisors are common in Mages guilds, and vice versa.</P>
<P>Collectively, the priests of Mystra are known as Servants of Mystery. Higher level
priests, both those with title and lands and those legendary adventuring priests,
are called Lords (and Ladies) of Mystery.</P>
<P>The hierarchy of the Mystran faith is wide and varied, separating into orders
concentrating on one form of magical energy or another. Mages, clerics, specialty
priests, and bards can all be found in its ranks without regard to experience level
or origin. The general rule of the Mystran faith is that talent and ability for the
job outweighs social rank or legendary feats.</P>
<P>Relations between the various orders and subgroups of the faith are very good.</P>
<P>The ceremonial gear of the priests of Mystra are simple blue robes accented by
a cloak of deep blue in the colder climates. Some form of headgear is required, though
this may range from a simple blue skullcap for the scholarly orders of the north
to wide, ornate, blue hats and helms in the southern lands.</P>
<P>In the field, all priests of Mystra wear armor, and bear the symbol of Mystra
on their shields as a display of their faith.</P>
<P>The clerics of Mystra wear veils and masks to draw attention to the mysterious
nature of magic.
