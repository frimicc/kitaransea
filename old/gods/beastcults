<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<P>Like elemental cults, beast cults vary from location to location and from beast
to beast. Two cults which venerate a &quot;lion god&quot; could be very different
in their ceremonies, appearance, and powers.</P>
<P>Typical Beast Cult Powers are shown on this page. Each Beast Cult can have one
of the following Granted Powers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The cult priest can summon a number of creatures of the worshiped type. This
will be 2-12 small creatures, 14 medium creatures, 1-2 large creatures, or 1 huge
creature. The creatures arrive in 1-3 turns.
<LI>The cult priest can transform into the type of beast he worships, gaining all
the abilities of that creature for 3-18 turns, once per week.
</UL>
<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>The beast cults believe in the existence of perfect forms of animals. A dog cult,
for example, believes there is a perfect dog, who is leader of all other dogs. A
cat cult believes there is a perfect cat, who is master of all cats regardless of
breed and size. They seek to tap into the power of these beings, who may or may not
be gods in their own right. Perhaps with sufficient worship, one or more beast lords
could achieve full-fledged godhood (though Malar, the Beast God, might have a few
words on the matter).</P>
<P>Beast cults may worship monsters in their &quot;ultimate forms&quot; as well as
normal animals. Priests of these cults only gain their special abilities at level
10 or higher.
