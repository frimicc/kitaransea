<UL>
<LI>Once per day, a specialty priest of Tymora may raise one die roll of any type
by one (a 1 becomes 2, 17 becomes 18, etc.). &lt;This modification must be announced
before the dice are rolled&gt;. The modified result is considered the true number
rolled.
<LI>The faith of Tymora is popular among halflings, in particular halfling adventurers.
Halflings may become specialty priests of Tymora within human Tymoran churches.

<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Tymora is one of the most common faiths in this region, in particular since it
caters most heavily to a highly mobile, relatively wealthy, and intrinsically powerful
group of adventurers who live by their wits and by their luck. There is a large network
of shrines and temples to Lady Luck throughout the heartlands of Wayland and Athmyr.</P>
<P>Each temple is its own independent operation with its own clergy. While each temple
recognizes the sovereignty of the others in their own regions, they tend also to
compete with each other like rival fishmongers, each declaring that their brand of
the faith is the most wholesome and the best for continued spiritual growth. Relationships
between the various temples are good, however, because all the various shrines benefit
from wandering adventurers.</P>
<P>The standard clerical dress varies from temple to temple as well, ranging from
full habits and headpieces in Atrek to simple robes in Selenica. Personal taste of
the patriarch influences the dress code, as does climate (natural and political)
and availability of fine clothing. The common item through all the various types
is the Disk of Tymora, usually carried on a small chain.</P>
<P>In ancient texts, Tymora is referred to as Tyche. Whether this is merely an earlier
name for the goddess, or a separate, now-dead entity (like Kipputytto or Moander)
is unknown.
