<H3>Granted Powers</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Specialty priests of Lathander turn undead at four levels higher than their listed
level, if that undead is affected by direct sunlight. Intelligent undead such as
vampires know about Lathander priests and will either avoid direct conflict or act
to remove their threat as quickly as possible.
<LI>At 3rd level, the specialty priest of Lathander may cast &lt;faerie fire&gt;
once per day.
<LI>Specialty priests of Lathander gain a +2 base bonus when using the following
proficiencies: appraising, artistic ability, juggling, musical instrument, pottery,
reading/writing, and singing. A specialty priest does not gain these proficiencies
automatically, but does gain the +2 bonus when using them. Additional nonweapon proficiency
slots devoted to these proficiencies increases the proficiency score normally.
<LI>A priest of Lathander, when confronted with a ward or runic symbol can try to
identify the symbol. Make two Intelligence checks. If the first succeeds, the priest
determines the type of person (bard, merchant, ranger, orc, etc.) who left the rune.
A second Intelligence check allows the priest to determine the general meaning of
the rune (warning, good food, ambush, ancient magic), though not the exact details
of the message.

<H3>Other Notes</H3>
<P>Specialty priests of Lathander call themselves the Morninglords, and there are
rumors of a secret society with that name consisting entirely of specialty priests
of this god. The clerics of Lathander call both themselves and their specialty brethren
the Dawn Priests, ignoring any difference. Only about 30% of the organized priesthood
is specialty priests, the remainder being clerics. A larger number of the adventuring
priests who are in service of the Morninglord are specialty priests. Each priest,
regardless of rank or experience level, is considered the master of the temple, shrine,
or parish he is responsible for.</P>
<P>Priests of Lathander dress in bright long-sleeved robes of yellow, red, and pink.
Those priests with their own temples have their robes trimmed with ornately crafted
gold ribbons. A sunburst headpiece, worn toward the back of the head to appear as
a rising sun or radiant sunpeacock, completes the ceremonial garb.</P>
<P>Adventuring clerics usually wear more utilitarian garb, but prefer reds and yellows,
to the point of tinting their armor those shades.</P>
<P>As may be surmised, most ceremonies of Lathander are held at dawn. Actions taken,
artwork completed, and contracts agreed to at dawn are considered &quot;blessed&quot;
by the god. Funerals are held at dusk, followed by a wake that lasts until dawn.
