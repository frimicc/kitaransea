Other Notes</H3>
<P>Chauntea is not the only god that claims druids as followers, but all specialty
priests of Chauntea are druids. Chauntea has some standard clerics as well, who operate
in more civilized areas typical druids would tend to avoid (such as overcrowded Gothos).
The split between the city church and the druids is about 30/70.</P>
<P>The relationship between the druids who call themselves &quot;the True Clerics
of Chauntea&quot;) and their urban cousins is polite but strained. Druids have always
venerated Chauntea and consider the more recent city disciples to be upstarts and
interlopers. The more civilized priests, in turn, feel that the druids' day is done,
and while druids are still useful in wild lands (such as Athmyr or the BlackHawk
Barony), the rising nations need an organized, professional faith controlled by a
more reasonable and rational clergy.</P>
<P>Both branches of the faith maintain simple dress. The druids prefer simple brown
robes with high rank denoted only by a belt laced with gold thread or some other
similar, precious decoration. The citified priests, on the other hand, wear an open-front
brown cloak with more standard garments, like tunic and trousers, underneath.
